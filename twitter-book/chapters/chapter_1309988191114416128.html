        <h1 class="chapter-title">53. Societies Evolve to Normalize Psychopathic Self-Presentation</h1>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">September 26, 2020</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I entertain the hypothesis that civilization doesn&#x27;t teach psychopaths to fake good manners but rather evolves to normalize psychopathic charm as the standard for polite behavior — that sufficiently advanced sociopathy is indistinguishable from good manners, per Kim Scott&#x27;s Radical Candor grid.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Observation: psychopaths are often charming/reassuring and can put you at ease in a trusting, vulnerable state.<br>
<br>
Hypothesis A: Psychopaths learn to fake norms of trustworthiness and reassurance<br>
<br>
Hypothesis B: Societies evolve to normalize psychopath behaviors as norms for all</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">B is very intriguing. What if all is non-psychos pick up highly manipulative behaviors as “polite and considerate” behavior via imitation of powerful psychopaths? And so all societies have psychopathic cultures of manners as their UX?</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Many of the actual kindest and most trustworthy people I know are ill-mannered. Not in the sense of being pointlessly rude or sadistic, but rough, uncouth, and ill-at-ease even in their own milieus. They can’t put others at ease.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Entertaining thoughts is fun. I guess why they call it entertaining. Building on that maybe I should host a party for thoughts, serve them alcohol (which I’d have to drink of course since they live in my head)</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Okay, just thought up a pretty robust case for B that this margin is too small to contain. I’m upgrading it to working hypothesis.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Logging interesting exchange with @aresnick <a href="https://twitter.com/aresnick/status/1310205567085031424?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-1">[1]</a></sup></div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Obv this is a subtweet thread of shit going on I can’t share publicly. <br>
<br>
My entire writing career is an extended subtweet. My memoirs should be titled “Subtweeting the Universe”</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Yep. Adverse selection ftw. <a href="https://twitter.com/Laeeth/status/1310285867202867202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-2">[2]</a></sup></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Trying on 2 summary aphoristic versions of the hypotheses for size<br>
<br>
A: Sufficiently advanced psychopathy/sociopathy is indistinguishable from good manners<br>
<br>
B: Civilization is the process of turning sociopathy into good manners<br>
<br>
B strikes me as more true</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Oh shit just realized @kimballscott 2x2 fits right into this theory. Ruinous empathy and manipulative insincerity are right next to each other and if you can’t tell real/fake “care personally” apart, they’ll look the same to you. </div>

</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">If you have low self-awareness you won’t be able to tell them apart even on yourself, and mistake your own manipulative insincerity for empathy. In the zone in between it may be ruinous for others but advantageous for you.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This is a tempting conclusion to draw but us actually survivorship bias. If you don’t actually successfully resist a manipulation attempt you might <strong>never</strong> realize it. This is one way redpilling works: revealing your manipulated condition to yourself. <a href="https://twitter.com/tdoggyholhol/status/1310289947572736001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-3">[3]</a></sup></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Subconscious = known unknown (“something is wrong here/spider sense tingling”)<br>
<br>
Unconscious = you register the data necessary to draw the right conscious conclusion but don’t actually do so, and might never do so. Doesn’t need repression. Just failure to think it through.</div>
