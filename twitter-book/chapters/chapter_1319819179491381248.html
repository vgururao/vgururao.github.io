        <div class="chapter-subtitle">October 24, 2020</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I argue that long-term thinking makes people unhappy because big problems reliably persist, that general capabilities reshape but never solve specific problems, and that mediocre people should focus on non-misery at each life stage — because if you&#x27;re miserable and not a Chosen One, you&#x27;re part of the problem.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">long-term thinking makes people unhappy because it almost necessarily means they’re thinking about big problems<br>
<br>
the only future thing you can be fairly sure about is that the big problems of today won’t go away miraculously and will last as long as you expect, probably longer</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">almost every problem people were worried about in the 80s when I was first taught to worry professionally like an adult is still there and has gotten worse exactly as predicted<br>
<br>
- overpopulation<br>
- water scarcity<br>
- global warming <br>
<br>
only exception is ozone hole which may come back</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">people do “happy” long-term thinking by building positive potential in the form of very general capabilities, like the internet<br>
<br>
downside is general potentialities never solve specific big problems, merely reshape them<br>
<br>
sometimes the reshaping makes them harder, sometimes easier</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">nuclear proliferation is still a problem, just a bigger, more chaotic one <a href="https://twitter.com/bpettichord/status/1319820994870169601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-1">[1]</a></sup></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">the leap of faith people make about working in generic capabilities rather than solutions to real problems (notice I <strong>didn’t</strong> scare-quote real) is that on average they’ll reshape more problems to be easier than harder, and so faster than more problems get added to the stack</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">so if in 1980 there were 10 level 4 problems the hope is a general capability will bump 7 of them down to level 3 and bump 3 of them up to level 5<br>
<br>
problem load reduction: 4*10-3*7-3*5=40-21-15=4<br>
<br>
but then another level 4 problem might have been added in the meantime</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">update it’s back 🤣 <br>
<br>
I hadn’t checked lately <a href="https://twitter.com/RaqWinchester/status/1319826561944739840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-2">[2]</a></sup></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">roslingism isn’t wrong, it’s just misconstrued, it shows that problems are in fact being reshaped and mitigated due to new potentialities, so indeterminate optimism is warranted<br>
<br>
the problem is rolling the dice may not solve problem in the priority order we think is necessary <a href="https://twitter.com/vr00n/status/1319822543944110080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-3">[3]</a></sup></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">roslingism is popular with free market types because it works well with markets<br>
<br>
everything will be fixed once the price is right<br>
<br>
the problem is the price and time may not be right at the same time</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">the market is just 1 mechanism in play, possibly the only one, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessary or sufficient for any given problem to get solved right at the right time, so that’s where i part ways with market fetishists who won’t entertain the possibility of alt mechanisms</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">other mechanisms, including state action and nonprofit action also reshape problems in unexpected ways, but it’s harder to make the leap of faith that on balance they’ll have a net positive effect<br>
<br>
that doesn’t mean they’re off the table, just more subject to hostile scrutiny</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">the big problem with state and nonprofit mechanisms is that their fans won’t admit that they have as much or worse indeterminacy and externalities built into their operation<br>
<br>
there is an illusion of determinate agency around them<br>
<br>
the stronger the illusion, the worse the effects</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">the older I get, the less of a stake I feel in big problems because the likelier it is they’ll stay stable/slowly degrading in my lifetime, and the easier it is to focus on my own narrower interests, and at most concern myself with general potentialities over specific mechanisms</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">one way I like to reduce this to individual mediocre human scale is to ask what’s at the intersection of effectiveness and non-misery at every life-stage?<br>
<br>
unlike Chosen Ones™ mediocre humans can’t be effective while miserable (though they needn’t be actually happy)</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">more to the point why bother? <br>
<br>
non-misery gives mediocre people something to fight to protect, giving them a reason to be part of the solution rather than the problem, and without coercion</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Chosen Ones™ are different for whatever reason<br>
<br>
maybe they are geniuses, or were bullied as kids, it doesn’t matter...<br>
<br>
you can model them as psychohistorical mules, random anomalous events that seed positive or negative potentialities that reshape the Big Problems Stack™</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">mediocre people I think should simply try to keep personal misery at bay, but in a broad-minded way, and differently at every life stage, reflecting the stakes of every stage, because if you’re miserable and not a Chosen One™ you’re almost certainly part of the problem</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">0-18 your best bet is probably skills development<br>
<br>
19-35 probably long-term thinking because you have the positivity of youth to overcome the the negativity burden<br>
<br>
36-50 probably support/catalyze positive potentials that are developing in your lifetime<br>
<br>
50+... ask me after 2024.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">turning 46 in a few weeks, definitely on the leeward slope of life in my head, almost certainly more life behind me than in front of me<br>
<br>
neither a part of the problem nor part of the solution to anything, but hopefully a net non-negative presence in the world</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">to bring it back around, I can’t really think in time horizons any more, short or long, but I do think in terms of temporal textures like lucky/unlucky timelines, and in terms of transforming bad textures into good ones, or poisonous moods into non-poisonous ones</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">maybe mood alchemy is the capability that interests me</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Gen X appears 10 years younger than it is because our prime decade fell through the cracks between the death of old media and the rise of social media. 1995-2005, the missing life decade. <a href="https://twitter.com/skyler__adams/status/1319845329550725120?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-4">[4]</a></sup></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">We are the undocumented digital migrants 🤣</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Though I totally coasted through that decade doing absolutely nothing worthwhile so it’s fair to edit it out</div>
