  <div class="tweet-text">Stuff you learned and forgot feels like rent paid. You lived in it for a while but are now left with no equity in it. Most schooling only rents you some knowledge for a while.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">You’re left with only enough knowledge capital to find and rent it again. Like knowing the address of apartments you’ve rented before. I don’t know much but I’ve rented a lot of stuff over the years. My address book is nearly full.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Well, it’s more than an address book. It’s a map. So there’s that.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Maybe this is why I’m meh on lifelong learning. A holistic philosophy of learning requires an attitude towards loss and degradation of knowledge too.  </div>

<blockquote class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">I’m clearly on to something here. Almost ratio’d.<br>
<br>
I may have discovered the vent in the hustleporn Death Star 😮 https://t.co/aazdUf9MQ0</div></blockquote>

</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I admire people who get into stuff like spaced repetition to strive mightily against such effects, but I have a more wabi-sabi attitude towards it. Kintsugi knowledge over valiantly maintained mastery. <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewm_webb/status/1272187530532839425?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-1">[1]</a></sup> <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewM_Webb/status/1272187530532839425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-2">[2]</a></sup></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Almost everything is worth knowing for a while or in specific situations. Almost nothing is worth knowing forever or in all situations. Most knowledge is only rent-worthy. When it degrades (a deeper, more irreversible kind of loss than mere forgetting) you should generally let it</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">We often fetishize ignorance (stuff we’ve never yet known) by performing some sort of pious humility to exhibit our consciousness of it. But curiously, we have no cultural attitude towards stuff once known but now lost. Or at least stored in ways requiring restorative work.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Temporal partitition of known-unknown:<br>
<br>
Once-known unknown: Stuff you used to know that’s now degraded<br>
<br>
Could-be-known unknown: Stuff you know is out there that you could know, like apartments you could rent<br>
<br>
Never-knowable unknowns: Stuff you know is beyond your learning reach</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Thing about knowledge degradation is that it is arbitrary and has only a weak relationship to retention desires.<br>
<br>
“It’s like riding a bike” effect. Ancient environment of evolutionary adaptation dictates that my somatic hardware retains bike-riding knowledge weirdly well. Shrug.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">2x2: Knowledge you’d like to retain/lose vs knowledge that actual sticks vs degrades. Aptitude = Stuff you’d like like to retain and naturally does get retained, making maintenance cheap (it sticks with little/no reinforcement like bike-riding, which I actually do want to retain)</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Curious that people find this to be a tragic line of thought. I find it liberating and am not really upset by it. In fact I kinda appreciate knowledge being naturally lossy.  <a href="https://twitter.com/tahsin_mayeesha/status/1272191000803336193?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-3">[3]</a></sup> <a href="https://twitter.com/tahsin_mayeesha/status/1272191000803336193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tweet</a><sup class="endnote-ref"><a href="#endnote-4">[4]</a></sup></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">“Use it or lose it” has a hugely important corollary: how much you have to use something to retain it varies enormously from “riding a bike” (afaict that’s once every decade after acquisition) to “must use every week and will be lost in months/years if not” like advanced math.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Your knowledge degradations form a unique fingerprint that create a signature style of how how you do new things. Like the gold seams on a kintsugi bowl uniquely identify its past of cracks and breaks. It still holds stuff, but in a unique way. Your brain is a kintsugi bowl.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Writing is a good example. Everybody retains/loses particular preferred/not-preferred words/idioms/usages that form a particular unique “voice” ... one that could be identified by an AI classifier and reproduced by gpt-2 type algorithms.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Feels like Homo sapiens is ready to evolve past uncritical fetishization of knowing for the sake of knowing (Homo... studentus?) to actual “sapiens” ("discerning, wise, sensible") by treating knowing as a commodity rent/buy decision for the most part.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">There is certainly a kind of pleasure to learning and acquiring knowledge, whether to rent or own. But uncritically maximizing that pleasure is a kind of hedonism. We just don’t notice because society approves of it morally, and rewards it economically.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Erudition: What you know<br>
Wisdom: What you know about what you know<br>
Humbletalebry: What you don’t know<br>
Prowess: What you can do<br>
Nihilism: What you must do<br>
Scholarship: What you know about who knows what<br>
Craft: What you’ve forgotten<br>
Artistry: What has irreversibly degraded</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Religion: What you refuse to know<br>
Tribalism: What you refuse to do<br>
Bureaucratism: What others must know<br>
Imperialism: What others must be able to do</div>
