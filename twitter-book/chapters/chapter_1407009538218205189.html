  <div class="tweet-text">When a proto-network is strongly under your control/influence (eg network of stores you can release a product in, large group of employees you can send a prompt to, fans of a movie franchise…), how do you trigger a network effect?<br>
<br>
Can you project manage a network effect?</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Trying to “go viral” is a bottom-up guerrilla thing. What’s top-down equivalent when you’re asymmetrically <strong>strong</strong>?<br>
<br>
Terms like rollout, deploy, cascade etc exist but point to command-and-control linear scaling alternatives to network effects rather than a network effect per se.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I’m trying to think of examples. I’m guessing DNS propagation is a bit of an example.<br>
<br>
You may or may not know the network structure, and that has effects. For eg you may offer 2 choices of computers A and B to employees, and you could negotiate bulk discounts if you knew…</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">… but individual surveys ahead of time don’t work because word-of-mouth influence.<br>
<br>
Can you influence that if you can’t force a choice? <br>
<br>
A somewhat realistic example is Pfizer vs Moderna in the US. Most people could figure out how to get the one they wanted. They chose via WoM.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">A “personal network effect” is how you arrange a workspace to trigger network effects in your brain (“inspiration”). A kitchen, workshop, writer’s desk, or painter’s studio should have a complete enough catalytic surface that “idea —&gt; network effect —-&gt; outcome” happens.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">A good metaphor is supercooled or superheated water. Small dust particle will trigger phase change to ice or steam.<br>
<br>
So managing a network effect = detecting/creating critical states and adding minimal trigger events.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Diff between top-down and bottom-up is you can probably create the conditions rather than waiting to detect and exploit them.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This is basically the OODA loop stated as a graph-theory problem. Create a positive network effect for yourself, and a negative one for adversary. Get lucky yourself, make them unlucky. Latter is a traditional bottom-up network effect, but former is the more top-down kind.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Related... thread on project management and why it gets in the way of this stuff. If you can do what this thread posits, what's left over will be like network effects management. </div>

<blockquote class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">53. Automating project management https://t.co/Agcls3dwYK</div></blockquote>

</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">In general, we need potential field theories of network dynamics that makes OODA usable as something more than an esoteric mandala to stare at till you get enlightened. Both these threads are me speculating about turning a philosophy into a technology through partial automation.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">It's kinda funny, but the bete noire of Boydian conflict theory, network-centric warfare theory, is kinda what I'm getting at here. In its original form, it's obvious why OODA and NCW were at odds. It's an evil-twins relationship.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">NCW tried to do with a sledgehammer and brute-force technology what OODA implicitly and unconsciously assumes is the soul of human skill. They tried to automate the wrong thing.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">In quoted PM thread, I posit a 3-layer thing, and the trick is to automate the middle. NCW tried to automate the top and bottom </div>

<blockquote class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">My working hypothesis is that project management is the &quot;caring&quot; layer in a 3-layer management pyramid that goes<br>
<br>
Truth (long-term, enduring, &amp;gt;1y)<br>
<br>
Caring (medium-term transient, &amp;gt; 1 week)<br>
<br>
Pleasure (short-term transient &amp;lt; 1 day)</div></blockquote>

</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">To take a time view of the interplay between network effects, potential fields, OODA loops, and project management... consider the dominance of all those things in your life in a given calendar year, January to December, due to "seasons" of civilized life...</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">January: high potential energy (PE), medium project management energy (PME), low network effects (NE), low OODA momentum (kinetic energy, KE).<br>
<br>
Feb-April: PE goes down, PME goes up, peaking at tax season, NE and KE are still dead in the water.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">May -- July: PME down, NE up, PE constant, KE low but starting to develop if you're lucky.<br>
<br>
Aug: sudden "wall"... everything crashes<br>
<br>
Sept-Oct: if you're lucky, PM low, PE --&gt; KE flowing, NE leveling off. This is the most productive couple of months.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Nov: PME starts ramping again due to budget/planning season, KE slows as you start wrapping up and trying to "deliver" from an organic momentum/network process that isn't suited to "deliverables" so you have to kinda kill it to deliver.<br>
<br>
Dec: Everything gets killed again</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Notice how shockingly similar this is to the seasonal harvest cycle! There's something to that analogy. Sow = potential, harvest = deliver. Network effect = rains at the right time to promote growth. OODA = managing a healthy crop through growth season.</div>
