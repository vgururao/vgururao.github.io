<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">51. Climate change is not solvable through politics and will fall to industry</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">52. There will be both left and right Neo-Puritanism on the national stage by 2035 and it will be tedious and awful</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">53. All humor is reactionary and if you want to retain the right to laugh, the best thing you can do is pick the best era to be reactionary about, which is the 1980s</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">54. Individualism is a cancer in the social organism that deserves to win</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">

</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">62. The most deeply subversive political skill is learning to see what’s real about other people, 1 at a time, not what’s fake about them, 1000 at a time. <br>

Learning to see the fakeness at scale wins you elections, learning to see unscalable realness wins you history</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">63. You can win elections and lose history, and vice versa, or win both, or lose both. Winning history matters much more than winning elections.</div>

</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">66. The global political future is headed for Fireflyverse: globalized, aestheticized, romanticized, sanitized, sentimentalized post-civil-war American south with Chinese characteristics. Where stupid people will be sustainably miserable.</div>

</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">80. Libertarian paternalism (aka Sunstein/Thaler Nudge models) is a bad idea in and of itself even if it doesn’t degenerate into basic paternalism</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">81. Every significant tech era retires a few ideologies and enables a few new ones. The ones being retired by software eating the world are: socialism, classical liberalism, eurocentrism, and identitarianism, and each is the core of a reactionary movement right now</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">82. No "new" ideology currently has a fully established claim to a seat at the big table as a new political actor, despite frantic posturing to pretend otherwise.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">83. The top 6 ground-level phenomenology trends driving the new politics are: climate change/energy transitions, housing in metro areas globally, aging and falling birth rates in west, migration, inequality and healthcare. Your opinions on these 5 things ARE your ideology.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">84. Asia (beyond just China) has forked off. There are now two competing Grand Narratives in the world.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">85. The financial/investment world has no clue what's going on, is afraid of everything, and has been largely reduced to One Weird Trick: financialization. The One Weird Trick is increasingly being executed by minds that have already retreated to New Zealand bunkers</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">86. Neither the 1% nor the under-the-API nouveau-poor (bottom 60%?) can invent the future that needs inventing now. It's up to the mediocre-normie middle class. It's a race between forces shrinking this class, and imaginative political actions emerging from this class.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">87. LOTR is about 2 political events: Tom Bombadil being disinterested in the ring, and Gandalf v. Balrog battle which happens offstage. The rest of the plot (Mordor v. Frodo's Army) is noise and fury signifying nothing. <br>
<br>
Yes this is a metaphor.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">88. All pure, radically decentralized political ideologies are bs because humans want maximally intimate belongingness so badly that they'll max out the technically possible scale of centralized organization every era. If a 7.5b hive mind were possible, 6.5b would sign up.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">89. I'd be in the 1b that would refuse to sign up for said hive mind in 88. It sounds awful, but then most humans are awful and would choose that state.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">90. Most bad politics arises out of bad literary tastes, as in enjoying stories about stereotypes. Good politics arises out of pattern matching archetypes while they still have "alpha" (predictive power) with a tasteful literary sensibility</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">91. Stereotypes are real, and there is always a subset of every stereotyped population that actually willingly conforms to that stereotype, performing it with an aggressive deadness. These dead player zombies are the core of all politics. All politics is about seeing dead people.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">92. All Straussians are wrong about almost everything just by virtue of being Straussian and being unable to come to terms with the central (heh!) role of mediocrity in the human condition. Their Noble Lies are mainly to themselves.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">93. Zizek is correct. The Normie ideology is cynicism, and conversely, all ideology turns into cynicism by the time it goes normie. This is why Noble Lie political philosophy is bs because there is no unawakened consciousness laboring under from it. <a href="http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/cynzizek.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ralph Dumain: &quot;The Autodidact Project&quot;: Slavoj Žižek: Cynicism as a Form of Ideology</a></div>

<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">94. Gandalf was from Ravenclaw</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">95. Opinion stolen from someone I've forgotten who: SE Asia has the potential to be the political laboratory of the future due to its diversity and topography (archipelago). One ideology tested per island, each with a Big Tech sponsor?</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">68. Big-tent-leftist-causes approach to climate are a bad idea both pragmatically and ideologically. It's a surgical cause.<br>
<br>
[Gonna slow-walk my own thread as a sort of threadapalooza median-pace-setting mechanism, and and add an opinion for every dozen or so I see float by]</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">69. Horseshoe theory is only applicable to hedgehogs and it is the primary hedgehog political derangement disease</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">70. Politics is unduly influenced by those with the time/energy to call their representatives and/or show up for town halls and things. It is 80% You're Not Yelping and only 20% Doing Noble Civic Duty.*<br>
<br>
* Hot take based on video clips on twitter</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">71. Dissensus is better than consensus, other things being equal</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">72. The global diffusion of regional cuisines and ingredients has been the biggest driver of goodwill, harmony, and collective mental health on the planet and aggressive purist evangelism of any diet aimed at “optimizing” nutrition for health alone is anti-humanist sedition</div>
