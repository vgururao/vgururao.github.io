  <div class="tweet-text">Football stadium is a better metaphor for twitter than public square. It’s just that the field itself is shrunken to nothing and the spectator sport is watching the stands across from you.<br>
<br>
National Sousveillance League.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">This is not a freeze-peach buyout proposal so much as a “use the stadium for hockey instead of football” type proposal. But since there’s no actual arena in the center, it amounts to “sell tickets to my kind of people and encourage the current fans to go build a different thing”</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">It’s a private sports league company, so they can do what they want, and I’ll take my stock cash-out and go, but I am pretty sure that more people want to play the current sport than the one Elon wants to see being played here, which means net shrinkage not expansion</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">I mean there’s a reason besides technical incompetence that things like Parler and Gab never really took off. A right-leaning thing that panders to free speech conceits of the classical-liberal-to-fascist half of the spectrum is a really boring non-spectacle</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">He’s a genius and I hodl Tesla, but I wish he’d stick to cars, rockets, etc. He’s a huuuge twitter whale who sees a very distorted imperial-scale-view of the action (he’s in the lowest row of seats that’s where the center of the field would be if there were a field)</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">You and I are somewhere halfway up stands based on number of followers. If you superimpose political compass on the stadium, I for example am in 50k circle of seats, roughly at 7 PM lib-left position. Most views are like mine: non-degenerate azimuth/altitude. Elon is at ~(0,0)</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">But what is sending serious alarm bells off in my head is that “free speech” in the last decade has never meant what it seems to. It is shorthand for “people I find annoying should shut up and people I like should get free <strong>reach</strong>”<br>
<br>
The speech/reach conflation runs really deep</div>



</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The paradox here is that I suspect most people are natural conservatives and the right of center half of the spectrum is actually 70% of the mass. But this is also the reason most people struggle with actual free speech as opposed to lofty mimetic posturing around their monarchs</div>



</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">In its current form, twitter probably serves the left half of the spectrum slightly better, and therefore 30% of the population. In the thought experiment where the game rules favor the other half of the spectrum/70% of the population, I suspect the sport would kinda implode</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Homogeneity is a barbell condition. If you have say, a bunch of 19th century European Christian white guys in wigs arguing, potential for verbal offense is pretty low, until it suddenly jumps high enough for world wars. There’s no middle ground of actual disputation.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">This is because the right half of the spectrum has odd views on “causing offense” that I think don’t scale beyond a small, homogeneous group that largely agrees anyway. And if they don’t the disagreement is so severe you rapidly get genuinely violent outcomes like war.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Left discourse only seems ultrasensitive to offense because it actually accommodates serious real diversity in a way grifty corp DEI programs pretend to. Despite its limits, twitter is basically the only place where I’ve met people from far beyond my limited circle of homogeneity</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Left discourse norms (not far left, plain shallow mediocre virtue signaling leftism without particularly deep convictions or agendas) are the only ones that have been shown capable of scaling to date. That doesn’t mean other norms can’t scale. I just don’t think Musk-norms can.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Musk’s proposal, besides being a Meme Stock Pseudoevent from Hell that has ruined poor @matt_levine’s vacation, is also an actual idea for alt-norms whose outlines are clear from his public behaviors. To his credit it is not pure reactionary fetishization of 19th c European norms</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">We have to be careful not to conflate what Musk clearly wants from what the Retvrn to Powdered Wigs and Statue Heads crowd wants. There’s elements of the reactionary to what he wants… but he likes jokes, memes, shitposting, and many other things that make modern twitter</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Ie there’s four norm sets competing for dominance here<br>
<br>
A: Shallow diverse-liberal (incumbent)<br>
B: Musk-weirdness<br>
C: Retvrn to Powdered Wigs<br>
D: Woke Thought Police Stalinists<br>
<br>
So basically Musk wants to replace A with B, riding the moral panic C feels over the threat of D</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">…all the evidence suggests he’s average-weak. He’s not particularly “good” at twitter even as a user, let alone as a social platform designer. He just has extraordinary leverage for ordinary levels of shitposting skill thanks to Other Factors™ that are NOT social.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">There is a particular risk and a general risk here.<br>
<br>
The particular risk is that Elon is not a god. He has incredible strengths and average weaknesses. I hold TSLA and would buy SpaceX in a minute if it were traded. He’s incredibly strong on that sort of stuff.<br>
<br>
But on this…</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Second, because of its unique role as a media thing, a management mode that’s not public in some way is simply not credible. I don’t mind a strong board/leadership and activist investors. I’d just like it to stay publicly traded.<br>

I mean look at the NYT.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">First, it’s not a “problem” to be solved. It’s an ecosystem to be managed/stewarded. There’s no Mars base or EV transition end game here. Twitter’s value is in sort of continuing and evolving indefinitely like a rainforest. “Solving” it is a pure authoritarian high-modernist goal</div>



</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">… <strong>even</strong> if, despite all odds, he is successful with twitter (and I hope he doesn’t want to be; this has gotten serious now), it’s a bad precedent.<br>
<br>
Even if you concede that twitter is somewhere between poorly managed and mismanaged (I don’t actually), this is a way to worsen it</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The general risk is of course that whatever his unique strengths/weaknesses, he’s also a super-billionaire<br>
<br>
If you think super-billionaires simply buying up large social phenomena to “solve” them because they don’t personally like the emergent behaviors, you’re a monarchist</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">I do think liberal democracies and their institutions (and twitter is one, as are literal football stadiums) can get trapped in local minima, and sometimes need an external kick in pants to break out.
