  <div class="tweet-text">You can at best target a research problem on a marketplace where someone has already declared a bounty, like say innocentive, nine sigma, etc (in which case they’re few and narrow).

a) long time between having an idea and having something to show for it that even the most sympathetic fellow crackpot would appreciate (not even pat for, just get)<br>

  <div class="tweet-text">With a blogpost, it’s like a week of effort at most from idea to mvp, and at most a 3:1 ratio of invisible to visible. That’s sustainable as a hobby/side thing. <br>

  <div class="tweet-text">John Carmack announcing he was quitting oculus to do indie research on AGI finally made the stark equation clear. You need Carmack-level starting points (indie wealth, established R&amp;D celebrity record) to go indie. That’s basically modern equivalent of old nobility.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">That’s the real deal.

  <div class="tweet-text">tldr: Get tenure, or get rich. Software has not eaten R&amp;D, and won’t eat it anytime soon. Possible outliers like Satoshi (who may have been in an R&amp;D institution or indie-wealthy in 2009 for all we know) notwithstanding.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Best-case outcome if neither applies: your idea has commercial potential and you can get a startup out of it. Which means the vast majority of ideas, both STEM and humanities, are out. Even I’m not optimist enough to think your R&amp;D on 16rh century French poets can be a unicorn.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The reason software doesn’t eat R&amp;D even though people think it should is that tools or open access to published lit/libraries, or free peer-reviewed publishing/presentation forums (if you want that) are only a tiny fraction of the cost for most ideas. The main host is time.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Even if the most expensive research tools like LHC or Hubble got as cheap as Arduinos, it wouldn’t help. That’s not the cost bottleneck. The bottleneck is researcher time. Even crappiest, cheapest conference paper I ever wrote took at least 6 months (~7k grad student salary then)</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">This isn’t cheap talk btw. I dropped 2k on a personal Matlab license after I went indie and kept it current for years, and went through dozens of false starts working on various ideas. Couldn’t find the time to develop any of them to even bad-conference-paper level.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Note: peer-reviewed publishing or patents just as depth cal9bration. I wouldn’t necessarily publish in such forms since I don’t think those institutional processes have ever added much to my work. Nor into them tbf, in the peer reviewing I’ve done.

  <div class="tweet-text">Note #2: I enjoy proper research, but wasn’t a great talent even at my peak and am now likely at 60%. So in a way this is an okay market outcome.

<br>
Learning projects to prepare to go deep on a subject are not research even if it feels like it<br>
