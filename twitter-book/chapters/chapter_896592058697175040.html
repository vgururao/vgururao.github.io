        <h1 class="chapter-title">6. Healing the Wounds of History</h1>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">August 13, 2017</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I argue that historical trauma works like financial debt — with compound interest — and that the pain of figures like Robert E. Lee and Genghis Khan must be consciously experienced before it can be retired, not buried under clever thinking or false enlightenment.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">1/ Vipassana-ing friend of mine said deep thing about wounds of history: someone has to experience repressed/deferred pain for it to go away</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">2/ There is a Genghis Khan statue in Mongolia. He's still central to their identity <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan_Equestrian_Statue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Equestrian statue of Genghis Khan - Wikipedia</a></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">3/ In India, people are <strong>still</strong> trying to rewrite history to paint Hindu losers of battles with Muslims from 13th, 16th centuries as victors</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">4/ By global festering-wound standards, the legacy of Robert E. Lee has not even scabbed over. This will take a LONG time to process.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">5/ I don't believe in afterlife type karma, but there is such a thing as historical karma. It exists because full erasure is impossible</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">6/ No matter what your politics, Robert E. Lee existed and means something in the stories some people need to tell themselves to go on</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">7/ So does Hitler. There may be no big statues of him, but he remains a potent symbol in global history-writing. Live cultural currency.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">8/ Beyond the historical specifics of their stories, heroes of alt-histories like Hitler and Lee are like currencies: of blood debts</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">9/ Today Genghis Khan is a healed wound for the most part, not an active cultural currency. We are free to view him as pure history data</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">10/ Why? Because the debts have been largely paid. The pains have been experienced over 8 centuries.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">11/ But there is a ton of outstanding pain debt left to be experienced in history books, before it can be retired. Dark matter. Work to do.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">12/ People approach the healing work differently depending on their spiritual bent. Christians seek to repent/forgive. Buddhists "process".</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">13/ Atheist techies are not immune. We frantically try to create more clean future so blood debts of history become trivial by comparison</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">14/ Whatever your coping strategy as a historically situated ape looking for meaning in aging rivers of blood flowing past scabs/wounds...</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">15/ ...One thing is for sure. The pain must be experienced in consciousness before it can be expiated from it.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">16/ Denying this is dangerous for the same reason denying finanicial debt is dangerous: there is compound interest at work</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">17/ Compound interest so powerful that a 147 years after Lee died, a 20-year-old felt the need to drive a car into a crowd over his statue</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">18/ Do not ignore the blood debts of history (with interest). Do not lie to yourself that pains can be buried without being experienced.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">19/ This shit has caused me pain in 2 countries/histories.  Your share of debt can't be willed away with clever thinking or 'enlightenment'</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">20/ Its not about you. It's about building roads into history that allow us to visit past painlessly. Just as taxes are about physical roads</div>
