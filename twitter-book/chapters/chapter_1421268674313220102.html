  <div class="tweet-text">I've been noodling on an idea for a while that I've been reluctant to do a thread on for... reasons that will become obvious, but let's yolo  it. I call the idea "charismatic epistemologies." Aka... how successful people explain the world, and how those explanations fail.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">I've been reluctant to do this thread because it runs the risk of specific successful people I know thinking I'm subtweeting them, which is ironic, because a big feature of charismatic epistemology is believing things are about you when they are not.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">My n size for this theory is probably several dozens. I've been around people who are far more talented and successful than me for like 30 years now, and sort of figured out how to free ride in their slipstreams. Sometimes parasitically, sometimes symbiotically.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">For a while, I was confused about this phenomenon because I was thinking of it as a minor special case of the fundamental attribution error, with minor additions. No, it's a distinct and richer/larger phenomenon. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Fundamental attribution error - Wikipedia</a></div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The FAE is the tendency to explain outcomes based on dispositional factors rather than situational, with a personal bias. As in "you just got lucky, I won by genius... you asked for your misfortunes, I got unlucky."<br>
<br>
But the FAE applies to all of us, not just outsize successes.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Charismatic epistemology is what you get when the fundamental attribution error meets an outlier success with a non-trivial evidentiary basis for their own uniqueness/outlier-ness.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">A familiar but peripheral example is simple, lazy self-mythologizing, as in a poorly written self-congratulatory autobiography. This is peripheral because it is something of a conscious construction, and the person knows they're doing it at least dimly/unconsciously.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Charismatic epistemology isn't about the story you tell about your <strong>own</strong> success story. It's how you explain the <strong>rest</strong> of the world by extrapolating from your own experiences. This is an egoist bias rather than an egoTist bias. <a href="http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-egoist-and-egotist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Difference Between Egoist and Egotist | Difference Between | Egoist vs Egotist</a></div>

  <div class="tweet-text">EgoTists are boring. Trump is an example. EgoTists not actually interested in the rest of the world. Only in themselves. The charismatic manifestation of EgoTism in a successful outlier person is narcissism. I'm not talking about narcissism in this thread.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Charismatic epistemology is something you get even with self-effacing, non-egoTistic egoists. And here I mean egoists in a broader sense than usual. People who believe they're special in some way, not necessarily "superior," but may or may not want to perform it egoTistically.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The sources of charismatic epistemology may or may not even be fodder for egoTism. Any innate trait or life experiences will serve -- being much taller or shorter than others, race, gender, early childhood trauma or privilege, extreme poverty or wealth, living through wars...</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">2 special cases of interest:<br>
<br>
One is people who've had extreme objective validation of their sense of specialness (scoring genius IQs when young, winning olympic gold at 16, becoming a big movie star at 21)</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421274403841576961">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421274403841576961" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421274403841576961')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">The other is people who've had experiences of specialness that are extremely NOT objectively validatable but they know from the inside were huge. Enlightenment type altered mind states, periods of deep suicidal behavior, life-altering but not very visible illnesses.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421275029413634052">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421275029413634052" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421275029413634052')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">So that's the eligible set. Note that this specialness is not of "everybody has some special shit if you look hard enough." This is actual outlier attributes relative to closer-to-the-mean humans. This is necessary but not sufficient for charismatic epistemology to emerge.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421276236379160578">

  <div class="tweet-text">Necessary+sufficient conditions are:<br>
<br>
1. Subjectively compelling (even dispositive) evidentiary support for your specialness<br>
<br>
2. Outlier success where your specialness is a non-trivial, salient explanatory factor.<br>
<br>
3. Tested predictive power of "I am special"<br>
<br>
4. Broad curiosity</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421276527161798657">

  <div class="tweet-text">If ALL 4 factors hold, you might develop a case of "charismatic epistemology."<br>
<br>
What are the features of this epistemology?</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421276837414465537">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421276837414465537" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421276837414465537')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">The biggest feature is: believing the universe works in a way where your account of your own success is Exhibit A. Ie the same laws that you think determined your successes, determine how the world itself works.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421277283000537092">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421277283000537092" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421277283000537092')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">For example, if a core belief of your explanation for your own success is "optimism and daring shapes events, and I won because I was optimistic and daring" you'll tend to explain everything else in terms of the effect of optimistic-daring.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421277856215142403">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421277856215142403" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421277856215142403')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">Several secondary features:<br>
<br>
1. You "do your own research" a lot<br>
<br>
2. You are acutely aware/sensitive to the flaws in how other people think<br>
<br>
3. When people disagree with you, you look for hidden agendas/backstories first, examine the merits of their arguments second</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421278154853810181">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421278154853810181" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421278154853810181')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">If this sounds similar to crackpot reasoning patterns, it is not an accident. It IS the same pattern, except that it is accompanied by high success and comes from your own life. For most crackpots, it is sort of "borrowed" from charismatic leaders they become true believers of.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421278504545517570">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421278504545517570" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421278504545517570')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">Ie, charismatic epistemologies that are born of successful and "different" people attempting to explain their own lives to themselves "seed" the crackpot epistemologies of... much less impressive people. But let's set that aside. This is not about the crackpot echoes.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421278865515696128">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421278865515696128" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421278865515696128')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">One interesting sign of this. The Peter Thiel "contrarian/heretic" question of a "secret" is designed to DETECT a charismatic epistemology at work. But it can't actually tell crackpots apart from the future outsize success types.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421279123360468995">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421279123360468995" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421279123360468995')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">So everybody who uses the "secret" question for diagnostic purposes tends to pair it with OTHER evidence to determine whether you're a genuine potential future success or a crackpot. Some people call it "earned secret" rather than just a "secret"</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421279686320025600">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421279686320025600" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421279686320025600')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">Cf necessary and sufficient... it's bidirectional. If you satisfy conditions 1, 3, and 4, there's a stronger-than-random chance you'll develop condition 2 (outsize success)... and if you have charismatic epistemology, chances are you got there via satisfying the 4 conditions</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1421280163585695749">
  <a class="tweet-permalink" href="#t1421280163585695749" title="Copy link to this tweet" onclick="return copyTweetLink(this, 't1421280163585695749')">&#x1F517;</a>
  <div class="tweet-text">The mechanics of this are mostly obvious, so I won't belabor them, but one mechanic is worth calling out. The "tested predictive power." People who develop charismatic epistemologies don't just make up just-so self-congratulatory theories about their past. They TEST them.</div>



</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">If you believe, for eg. that having a green-dyed beard is a big part of your success, you'll actually try to prove this, by (for eg) giving important speeches with and without green-dyed beards. And these experiments will prove you right! Green beards lead to success!</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Now this is where charismatic epistemologies start to turn cancerous, and any genuine explanatory power starts turning into your personal pseudoscience. Now why might your "green beard" theory prove out?</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The thing is, success is non-ergodic! Once you start succeeding, you lose the ability to systematically experiment with your own success factors because it has <strong>already</strong> altered your decision environment!</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">This is the "reality distortion field." It takes a while for it to grow to Steve Jobs size and power, but it is visible fairly early on a success trajectory of any sort. I've met enough people "before" and "after" that I've now seen it multiple times.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The more you succeed, the more people around you will adopt complementary patterns of effective behavior to ride your coat-tails, and the more they'll reinforce the theory of success.

  <div class="tweet-text">It's a bit like a stock market effect, where a stock goes up and up and up because more money pours in, and up to a point, actually makes future success more likely.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Notice the positive feedback effect here: you are confidently espousing a theory of success, backed by a track record... the confidence and success attract ever-more talented people hoping to leverage your "formula" to succeed themselves.

  <div class="tweet-text">This is, in my experience... basically true. Good leaders are weirdly, presciently, right. In a series of uncertain, ambiguous decisions, where rational analysis might expect say a 30% hit rate, they're hitting 80-90, even 100% for brief periods.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">A dark cartoon version of this played out, for eg. in QAnon circles leading up to, and beyond, election night. Something very like this happens around every late stage charismatic epistemology that is wandering abroad far from where the world is flat.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The central charismatic figure at this point can react in many ways. <br>
<br>
Some react by progressively cutting off people who are starting to stumble. The circle of "good people" starts to shrink and tighten. More and more people get cut out. It's a LIFO effect.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The healthiest reaction is to recognize what's going on, and <strong>realize that there is no easy way out.</strong> The only way out is to take a looong break where you stop running the success script entirely, and wait for the RDF to wane and dissipate and ultimately collapse.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">This will happen because if you just stop using the charismatic epistemology, it will stop feeding large groups of people and developing in strength. My guess is a field that takes 10 years to build up takes about 1-2 years to dissipate.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">But I don't want to write a whole grand unified thesis here. So I'll close with a personal angle. One reason I've developed these theories is that I've spent a lot of time around people with charismatic epistemologies, and built something of a career out of pen-testing them.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The reason I have this career is that many in the early stages of success and a modest RDF dimly recognize the risks and want it challenged enough to prevent cancerous over-extension, but not so much that it gets undermined even where/when it works.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Haters and actually hostile critics are like actual hackers in this picture.
