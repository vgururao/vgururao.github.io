        <h1 class="chapter-title">32. Turing-Complete Identities</h1>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">March 31, 2019</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I connect the end of history to identitarian consensus — when everyone agrees what boxes everyone is in — and argue that restarting history requires not simple role-swaps but Turing-complete narrative mutations, where characters and worlds evolve together in irreversible entanglement.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">History is all the identities we’ve inhabited so far</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Kinda makes sense that the end of history would be marked by terminal identitarianism. Consequence, not cause. If nobody can find a way to continue everybody’s identity evolution, history ends.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Identitarian consensus: when everybody agrees what boxes everybody is in. It’s a much deeper state of stable equilibrium than everybody simply having a fixed identity. The way common knowledge is a deeper equilibrium than mere belief or even mutual belief.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">There was a funny Volkswagen ad where an Indian guy responds to some question about yoga with “just because I drive a Volkswagen you think I’m into yoga?”<br>
<br>
It’s funny because it simultaneously acknowledges and subverts an identitarian consensus<br>
<br>
Also Seinfeld anti-dentite joke</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">An identitarian consensus is also a set of roles and permissions within a narrative. Stereotyping is just the shallowest layer. History ends at an identitarian consensus not because the narrative ends but because it becomes 100% tropey</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">The instinct behind simple role-swaps (eg female or black superheroes) as a way to break out of an identitarian consensus equilibrium is solid but... naive. Like transposing a tune to a new key rather than composing a new one. Doesn’t restart history, just phase-shifts it.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">An example of a history-restart type shift is from Campbellian Monomyth hero to LeGuinesque Carrier Bag unheroine. Doctor Who pulled that off, though it has other weaknesses.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Real history edition: when women stop leading like men. Good or bad, you can’t ignore the fact that it’s equilibrium-breaking history restart/reboot. This ain’t Margaret Thatcher or Indira Gandhi style <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/opinion/women-leadership-jacinda-ardern.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">nytimes.com/2019/03/30/opi…</a></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">The link between end of history and identitarian consensus also explains why “diversity” as a simplistic alternative to a straight-white-male-centric equilibrium doesn’t work for anything except post-apocalyptic survivalist stories. That’s just the aftermath of the end of history</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">To extend the music metaphor, this is not a transposition, it’s a polyphony degenerating into a cacophony. Random noise around an EoH equilibrium.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Experimenting with fiction has shown me just how terrible social identities are for writing believable, growing characters. It’s almost like trying to make an address behave like a house. A category error. An address can let you guess a lot about a house but isn’t itself a house.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Otoh, you can’t just make up a character from, say, a set of archetypal inner paradoxes. The context matters in a way that becomes immediately obvious when you try to name a character. A name instantly induces a world.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">The thing about history-reboot level narratives is that any one local binding, like the name of a key character, immediately binds the rest of the narrative as well. Choosing any one thing is like choosing everything. And now the whole story is a clockwork deterministic universe.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">The best you can do is “glitch” the global binding a bit by simultaneously acknowledging/subverting a piece of it, like my Volkswagen-yoga example. This is not an archetypal paradox driving a character OR a world paradox driving a history. It’s the nexus <strong>between</strong> the two.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This creates <strong>just</strong> enough room, like a 99.9% global binding instead of 100%, for history to get restarted. Tiny new root sneaking through the cracks of a tessellation defining a world.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">An example of doing more is Dark Materials, where cosmetic similarities suggest a glitchy parallel universe that’s not quite like ours. Deepness in the Sky also pulls that off by constructing an uncanny valley of spider-beings whose story is told via overwrought human mapping.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Note btw that most science fiction is only cosmetically a building of alternative worlds. Much of the average stuff is simple relabeling. The better ones just acknowledge it openly.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I’ve been trying to systematize these intuitions by playing with situated archetypes that work across a whole class of worlds rather than inducing a specific one. Then you suggest the whole universe via “beat” frequencies that emerge in juxtaposition with a familiar universe</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Getting back to history, a narrative is only a history if it’s not in an end-of-history identitarian consensus equilibrium. Good fiction has the feel of history.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">It’s not enough that the world changes (plot) or characters grow individually or in mutuality. The world and characters must change together in, for want of a better term, Turing complete ways. Even a strange attractor or brownian motion won’t do.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">It’s the entanglement that evolves irreversibly. And the characters don’t have to be “rich” in a literary sense for this. In fact that’s often a liability. Even 2d caricatures that are terrible by rules of “good” character dev can drive historic narrative if entangled right</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This stuff is very hard. That’s why only a few cases have been solved analytically. For example evil twins from evil parallel universes who differ in social identity only by a goatee (van dyke actually...) is a surprisingly sophisticated device if you dig a bit into it.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">“Good” and “evil” are shorthand codes/world-hashes for 2 different narrative equilibria, with a leak in either direction capable of restarting history. Good/evil is a property of the <strong>entanglement</strong> between the characters and home universes.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Importantly, social identity is <strong>only</strong> an address. That is why a trivial marker (facial hair) works to distinguish the two universes. It happens to be gendered but that’s unimportant. It could be a nongendered trait like long hair.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Interestingly, Marxist thought gets this whole idea in a degenerate way: “none of us is free until all of us are free” or “the oppressor requires liberation as much as the oppressed.” That’s a good special case of entangled history.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Where it fails is treating aspects of the context, like class, as immutable. A workers paradise isn’t classless. It’s a degenerate one-class, end-of-history society. To transcend class-structure, you need something with equal expressive power that preserves Turing-completeness.</div>
