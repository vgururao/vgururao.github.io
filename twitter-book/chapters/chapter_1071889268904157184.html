        <h1 class="chapter-title">18. External vs. Internal Locus of Control</h1>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">December 9, 2018</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I complicate the standard theory of locus of control by arguing that external-locus people run hot — not helpless — and that managing their explosive, outward-directed energy is the central unsolved problem of institutional design, from entrepreneurship to societal meltdowns.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">There are 2 kinds of people: external versus internal locus of control (ELoC vs ILoC), based on how they tend to explain events, and whether they favor attributing external or internal factors. You can tell them apart by heat signatures of their responses to things going wrong.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I think the traditional theory of LoC is incomplete. It tempts you to conclude that  ELoCs feel “helpless”and therefore act less energetically when things go wrong. No, in fact they act MORE energetically than ILoCs, who respond with restrained energy. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Locus of control - Wikipedia</a></div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This is NOT extrovert/introvert. Both can be either ELoC or ILoC.  Example, in Myers-Briggs terms, INTJs tend to be ELoC, but INTPs tend to be ILoC. It’s where you explain things (inside or outside) not where you “live”. <br>
<br>
But misaligned E’s or I’s create extreme temperaments.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">ELoCs run hot. When things go wrong, they tend to react with high-energy patterns targeting outside world, often angry/violent ones. <br>
<br>
ILoCs run cold. When things go wrong they turn inward into deeper introspection low-energy patterns until they are barely alive. <br>
<br>
I’m ILoC obv.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Yes, ELoCs think events can be explained by factors outside their control, but no they don’t react with helpless resignation. They typically ACT to either bring those factors into their control, or more commonly, try to forcefully influence those they see as having the control.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Speculative 2x2<br>
<br>
ILoC+introvert =  Chronic Depressive/bipolar<br>
ELoC+introvert = Hikkikomori/cold-revenge server<br>
ILoC+extrovert = Drama Queen<br>
ELoC+extrovert = Chaosmaker</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This should be obvious from the definition. If someone tends to blame external factors and people for their suffering, there’s a good chance they’ll turn into problems for those blamed factors. ELoCs spread their pain around to make their problem everybody’s problem.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Enough about ILoCs. We talk way too much about them. Let’s talk ELoCs.<br>
<br>
ELoCs are often seen as “problem people” in bad situations because their “bad-state” responses are high-energy. You can ignore a low-energy ILoC fuck-up but an ELoC fuck-up demands management from others.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">ILoCs are well-understood because they tend to self-document exits from bad (low-energy) states in autobiographical writing. ELoCs help by supplying high-energy stimuli like dragging ILoC friends out of shells. People who like “introvert” memes are often actually ILoC extroverts.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">When Churchill said “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” he was thinking ELoCs. People who add energy to a problem whether or not they also add commensurate intelligence to help resolve it. Energy without intelligence is explosive energy.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">To the extent a problem is shared by a group, ILoCs tend to exit shared problems if nobody cares to “save” them. ELoCs otoh, if unmanaged by others, tend to become part of the problem, and further down the death spiral, bigger than the original shared problem.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">You have to feed them a steady stream of correctly calibrated “luck” and “merit-based wins” to stabilize. Since they NEVER turn inward to explain anything, only external stimuli work. I suspect cognitive-behavioral therapy fails on such people.  They need pure behaviorism.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">But then they turn around, get all holier-than-thou, and get madder and madder punching UP in a mean-spirited way. Lining up a small dose of luck turns them ‘nice’ again.<br>
<br>
Keeping anELoC in a healthy band of generous-spirited motivation is hard.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">ELoCs — External-locus-of-control people — are exhausting to be around. When down, they keep punching down harder and harder in a mean-spirited way, getting madder and madder. Only thing I know of that flips them to ‘nice’ is lining up a small skill-based win for them...</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Don’t get me wrong. ELoCs are an important part of healthy societal problem solving. They bring all the energy and the focus on external factors needed if indeed that’s the locus of the problem. They are the ‘unreasonable’ people all change depends on.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Or to put it another way, cognitive reframing etc are weak behavior change levers if there are very few frames to begin with, and they’re all mostly unconscious firmware. Their conscious frames are about modeling external factors. Mostly external “people” factors. Blame frames.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Introverted ELoCs are particularly dangerous since they can seethe in resentment for years, accumulating energy, until they finally blow up. Often described as a “silent majority.” Probably better described as “ticking time bombs.”</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">But when they “break bad”,  especially on wicked problems with big internal AND external contributing factors, ELoCs, who are probably the majority, can turn cancerous. They bring change energy to the party with no good ideas. Result: things go BOOM! <br>
<br>
Societal meltdowns.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">An ILoC at the end of his rope is likely to commit suicide. If the cause is external, ultimate failure mode of looking internal is to run out of life energy in isolation.<br>
<br>
ELoCs too, commit suicide at the end of their rope, but like to take as many people with them as possible.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">But at macro scale things are much harder. ILoCs never cause collective level problems because they retreat, self-isolate. But ELoCs can connect, feed off each other and turn into explosive metastasized societal problems. True believer mobs etc. ILoCs can’t easily “manage” this.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">If you are ILoC and have ELoCs in your life you will learn to manage them with merit-win+luck game-making, and they’ll swing between hating/thanking you for it. That’s your cross to bear. They’ll return favor by pumping you up when you’re low-energy. That’s their cross to bear.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Institutional failure is almost always ELoC containment failure.  ELoC introverts connecting and blowing up. ELoC extroverts turning to crime or cult leadership (there’s a Baumol paper about the latter). <br>
<br>
We’re in a condition of near ELoC meltdown right now.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">In fact a great deal of societal/institutional design is devoted to ELoC management: making sure ELoC introverts have safe outlets so they don’t accumulate “Cold Revenge” energy, and ELoC extroverts have zones to act where chaosmaking is an asset, like entrepreneurship.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This is the fundamental asymmetry of LoC sociology. During general bad times, full of both internal and external factors driving multiple wicked problems, you get both a suicide epidemic AND an epidemic of suicide-bombing type events. The latter is the bigger problem.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I don’t have answers here yet, but I think this is the question next-gen institutional design (my current big interest) has to answer: How do we control and manage ELoC energy so it powers society steadily instead of blowing it up every decade.</div>
