        <div class="chapter-subtitle">January 26, 2015</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I explore the concept of bearing witness, and its relationship to the ethics of citizenship, with reference to the legendary cartoonist R. K. Laxman.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">1/ Let's talk about a deceptively simple-seeming concept: to bear witness.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">2/ To testify is an after-the-event act. To bear witness is a broader behavior that includes how you are present within an event</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">3/ You can act or intervene in an event, but the simplest way to bear witness is to simply not look away, and be seen to see.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">4/ This is power. If you see somebody being harassed in the subway and look straight at the act instead of away, you bear witness.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">5/ When you bear witness, you force the enacted narrative to reflect on itself, without saying a word.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">6/ This is why the characteristic phrase of a bully feeling threatened by someone bearing witness is "what are YOU looking at?"</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">7/ The power of bearing witness is that you don't need to contest the narrative: the actor being witnessed does it himself.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">8/ Through your silent, "I see you," you force the actor to acknowledge that they are knowingly enacting a false narrative.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">9/ I rarely do eulogies, but this was what R. K. Laxman was: someone who bore witness through his work.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">10/ His character, The Common Man, never spoke in the cartoons. He was simply present, looking on bemusedly.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">11/ Laxman was not the greatest comic. His jokes were not always funny. But The Common Man was a masterful invention.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">12/ The political rhetoric of post-Independence India was ALL about 'aam aadmi': The Common Man.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">13/ From Nehru to Modi and Kejriwal, all have presumed to speak for the Common Man.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">14/ Laxman did not challenge this presumption directly by giving the Common Man a critical or satirical voice.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">15/ Instead, he simply mirrored the hypocrisies and bullshit of the political classes by having his character bear witness to it.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">16/ This is what made Laxman <em>the</em> cartoonist of post-independence India.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">17/ He was not always the most politically astute. To those who do not understand his milieu, he can appear somewhat tame.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">18/ His cartoon commentary was not radical. It was even pedestrian at times. But the Common Man elevated every gag panel to sublime.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">19/ Laxman knew this, as his writings show. He did not claim political genius or astuteness. He knew his power lay in bearing witness</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">20/ In a deep way, my own writing, while lacking the brevity of cartoons, is about bearing witness. I learned that from Laxman.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">21/ You need no genius to bear witness, nor great insight. Just the willingness to stay present and not look away.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">22/ You do not need to even understand or challenge what is going on. The witnessed will challenge themselves.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">22/ RIP R. K. Laxman, 1921-2015. The First Witness of modern India.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._K._Laxman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">R. K. Laxman - Wikipedia</a></div>
