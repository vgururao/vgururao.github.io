  <div class="tweet-text">The word “invest” has 2 distinct meanings in relation to capital:<br>
<br>
Invest (1): Spend money to build a capability. Example: a bridge, a factory, a mansion.<br>
<br>
Invest (2): Spend money to acquire a formal stake in an existing capability. Example: stock, bond, lien.<br>
<br>
2 now dominates 1</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The two are coupled. For example, you invest (2) in my company so I can invest (1) in a new factory. Instead of shareholder value or a dividend, you might claim a share of the output at a good price for example (offtakes, kinda like futures) <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offtake-agreement.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Understanding Offtake Agreements in Project Financing</a></div>

  <div class="tweet-text">To me it seems like the natural arrangement. The recent thing with negative oil prices should not seem weird at all. When you buy oil futures, the natural assumption should be that you’ll actually take delivery. Invest (2) should imply a direct stake in invest (1).</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">It’s a moral hazard to purely invest (2) in money-in-money-out (MIMO) ways. You have no interest in how black box works. All knowledge risk lies with investee.

  <div class="tweet-text">This is the definition o dumb money.

  <div class="tweet-text">If you have 10s of millions of dollars, it <strong>matters</strong> how hard you, PERSONALLY think about where to put it. Even a single degree of delegation creates huge principal-agent distortions. To the extent some wealth creation opportunities need concentrated capital, the rich must think.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Ie capital is too mobile. It has ADHD. It rarely hangs around long enough to learn about survival in a given evolutionary niche and create civilizational wealth there. The exception is when people like Musk force money to pay attention, making invest (1)= invest (2)</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Notably capital markets have a notion of seeking alpha (novel information to guide investment) but no notion of how long that information needs to be acted on to realize value. New alpha simply moves the money, regardless of whether or not it actually invalidates previous alpha.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">It’s obvious why. Because capital is so imitative, the primary payoff of alpha is convincing others there <strong>is</strong> alpha. Most invest (2) is a bigger-fool scheme that has zero structural interest in the actual meaning of a piece of alpha.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">There have been ideas like long term stock market etc, but I think they’re too crude and give up too much information sensitivity. <br>

Kind of thing I have in mind would be stocks that act like bonds. What if stocks were priced based on how long you were willing to hold?</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Not RSUs or options per se. The same stock would cost $10 instead of $15 if you committed not to sell until next year etc. Ie invest (2) would effectively rent, not own equity. But not in the sense of options.

  <div class="tweet-text">One of the reasons I’m in indie consulting is I only have time to invest, not money.

  <div class="tweet-text">Not all consultants do this. There are lazy equivalents to investors (2) who you can call consultants (2).

  <div class="tweet-text">There is a motivated interest in doing this. Humanizing contact falsifies glib generalizations like “the poor are just lazy” or “the rich are just venal” and class-based theories of how things fail.

  <div class="tweet-text">Writing <strong>about</strong> the petit bourgeois is almost universally unsympathetic. Much of it by members of the class themselves, via ritual self-flagellation.

  <div class="tweet-text">But middle-class societies tend also to be the ones in which human nature evolves fastest, through identity creative-destruction, as tidal forces of contempt from above and below tear apart and reconstitute the class, every generation.
