  <div class="tweet-text">Been thinking a lot about animal trials in medieval europe and how we've not just reversed the idea of animal criminal culpability, but extended it to certain classes of humans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_trial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Animal trial - Wikipedia</a></div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Anybody who gets away with a "look what you made me do!" defense for their actions is asking to be basically extended the protection of presumption of animal non-culpability for their actions.

  <div class="tweet-text">People on the right tend to make such arguments on their own behalf (both rich and poor... "look what the liberals made us do"). People on the left tend to make them on behalf of others less fortunate who may or may not appreciate the animal-status patronizing.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">One reason I'm thinking about this is that now that we've stopped bothering about explanations for why Trump rose to power and to some extend assumed that his 2nd term is the null hypothesis, narrative energies are being diverted to judgment rather than explanation.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The explanation part for his rise has defaulted to the animal level. His supporters are not responsible for voting him into office, and he's not responsible for what he's done there so far. The judgment part for ongoing behaviors has become curiously suspended altogether.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">It's an interesting symmetry break. Both sides agree on this for once: liberals have agency, conservatives don't. Liberals are governed by evil values and do evil things.

  <div class="tweet-text">So the Discourse is 100% about judgment of the left. In this narrative, the impeachment trial is not-even-wrong theater, like a medieval animal trial based on poorly scoped ideas about who has moral culpability.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Only the question of "How Woke caused the Weirding with malice aforethought" is judgment worthy. The guilty verdict for 100% of the blame is already in. Only sentencing remains. Other parties are not so much blameless as ontologically unfit to stand trial as humans with agency.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">This is really surreal. A shit ton is going wrong in all parts of the world, on all sorts of fronts (climate, finance, war, tech). But the only people being morally held to account for any of it is those subscribing to woke ideologies.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">As a thought experiment, what if actual condition is the reverse: everybody <strong>except</strong> the wokies has moral culpability. They've had their brains rotted by some sort of vague intersectional mind virus written in COBOL. Ignore and isolate them. This actually rings more true to me</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Not going anywhere in particular with this line of thought. I don't think blame and judgment subplots of narrativizing history are either futile or the whole story.

  <div class="tweet-text">To the extent that the blame/judgment subplot has gotten itself into a weird narrative bind where only a tiny subset are subject to it, the narrative mechanism has broken, and either needs to be fixed, or other parts of the mechanism need to pick up the slack.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">I think I know why we're in this condition. The thing is, ideologies only accept accountability for loci of agency they see as legitimate, so everything that happens at other loci is the fault of people who see agency there as legitimate.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">I'm reminded of the oddest conversation about vegetarianism I've had, with an Egyptian. Most meat eaters accept moral agency/culpability that might be involved in choosing to eat meat. But this guy's response was "but the Koran tells us to eat everything!"<br>
