        <h1 class="chapter-title">8. Unboxing in Unbundling</h1>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">October 9, 2017</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I explore the hidden costs of software-driven unbundling by focusing on the &quot;box&quot; — the institutional container — and argue that when you unbox organizations into networks, critical meta-functions like sustainability and indirect cost support don&#x27;t magically re-emerge for free.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">1/ A neglected aspect of software-driven unbundling is unboxing: the elimination of a containing element in an old bundle</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">2/ Unboxing and reboxing constitutes a bigger proportion of unbundling the more abstract the product. At the limit boxes = institutions.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">3/ When music gets unbundled/unboxed from albums to songs, containing/support elements at the "album" level (jewelcases, liner notes) vanish</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">4/ When books get unbundled into serialized blog posts, prefaces, indices, cover art and (for physical copies) bindings vanish</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">5/ What is interesting about these elements is that they often embody a lot of the socialization and transaction cost logic of a thing</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">6/ Gold/platinum records, autographing of copies of books, credit attributions, pricing tiers, access control, security etc are at box level</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">7/ As a first approximation, the box value vs. content value reflects the transaction costs vs. cost of the product/service</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">8/ Even better, the box-cost as a proxy for transaction costs actually captures a lot of illegible tx costs beyond explicit Coase ones</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">9/ Box-cost includes, besides search/negotiation/monitoring costs, such intangibles as memetic socialization, pricing psychology etc etc</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">10/ Okay, all this is a set up for what I actually want to talk: organizations. These things are <strong>primarily</strong> boxes. They're like Coke/Pepsi</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">11/ About 150 years ago, if you wanted to drive societal change through institutions, you'd fund things like universities: "mission boxes"</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">12/ The boxes got smaller and smaller. Institutional ambitions went from nation-state level to university level, to lab level</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">13/ At some point, rather than get smaller, institutional ambitions began manifesting in unboxed forms and calling themselves "networks"</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">14/ Institutional forms didn't suddenly "discover" networks as an organizing structure. They merely unboxed them and allowed them to connect</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">15/ Example: founders of w00w00, the hacker collective, cited Xerox PARC as an inspiration. PARC was a network in a leaky box, w00w00=no box</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">16/ Here's something we don't yet know: where do the box-level attributes/features of institutional landscapes go? There is no simple answer</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">17/ Unlike unbundling/rebundling of content/functionality, which is relatively lossless, unboxing/reboxing tends to be extremely lossy</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">18/ Some "box" functions migrate to interior. Bibliographic references of books turn into hot links inside the text. Indices become search.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">19/ But many are lost. Since a lot of the logic contained in box layer serves longer-term meta-functions, you don't notice till too late</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">20/ One sign is shifting patterns in institutional funding. Unboxing is often accompanied by big cost reductions. Not all is wastecutting</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">21/ When you fund a project instead of an institution that will undertake the project, for instance, you make it less sustainable</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">22/ Indirect cost support (the ~50% overhead univs get for government research funding) was important historically because it was box money</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">23/ Indirect cost support <strong>created</strong> the research university after WW II. It didn't happen by magic. Something deinstitutionalizers don't get</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">24/ There is a tendency to believe that Internet can magically substitute for box-level functions in organic/emergent ways. True and false.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">25/ True part: Self-organizing systems can evolve the right structures to capture any kind of value a top-down designed "box" can</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">26/ False part: they can do so at zero cost. When you unbox and rebox the research university, you don't have to create a new kind of box...</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">27/ But your "emergent box" (for example, fora like arXiv) do need the equivalent of indirect cost support flowing towards them somehow</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">28/ A broad way to understand this is that the Internet, as an institutional stack base-layer, lacks indirection/persistence dynamics</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">29/ So while I'm all for de-institutionalizing the Industrial Age and its dinosaur institutions, I'm skeptical that it will be lossless</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">30/ The Internet is not institutional magic-sauce. It can't create something out of nothing, or costlessly store/embody stuff.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">31/ The net needs financial plumbing to fuel network-mode reboxing that can persist value of no immediate value but that we'll regret losing</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">32/ "Reboxing" is the wrong term actually. Unboxing is the right term for the destruction process, but the creation process deals in flows</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">33/ We need flow metaphors for reboxing. Something like adding insulating layers to pipes or something. Not entirely sure where to take that</div>
