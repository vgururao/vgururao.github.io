Another: some sets built at 2 scales, one for human and elf, another for hobbits and dwarves. They picked slightly taller dwarf actors to avoid 3.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">In many ways this was a bigger achievement than MCU. MCU is 10x bigger in scale (40 films?) but is relatively much looser material, more forgiving tonally (humor &gt; drama) and done in a far better tech era 10-20y later, with far more mature CGI. It’s also more uneven.</div>

Stretching 1 movie into 3 instead of compressing 3 into 1.

  <div class="tweet-text">One of the reasons LOTR is unique is it's a rare true trilogy, not spilling over into 4, 5, 7, 10 books. Beyond 3-4 volumes of a single core storyline, I think you are forced to go to prestige TV to get it right. Nobody has patience for 3+ movies in a straight-line story.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">MCU works because it's a poset rather than a straight line story.<br>
<br>
Foundation, Wheel of Time, etc. had to go to TV. LOTR prequel based on Silmarillon material too... more TV than movies.<br>

Dune is the exception. A zillion books, but only like the first 2.5 are any good.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Reading Terra Ignota now. I think that would work as a trilogy (it's 4 books). Recently read Lillith's Brood. Also trilogy suitable. And Schismatrix Plus perhaps. In fantasy... any major material that stops at 3ish and hasn't been done? I think Gormenghast perhaps.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">3 movies is really optimal for a single storyline. Another that nails the medium-story fit is the Nolan Batman trilogy. Original Raimi Spider-Man tried, but unravelled completely in the third part. By the time we got to Avengers, the extended universe context made it different.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">I actually can't think of any single storyline movie series that worked to 4+ parts.
