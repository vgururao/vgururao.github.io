        <div class="chapter-subtitle">September 21, 2020</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I argue that if something is worth doing for free, it&#x27;s worth nerding out on obsessively — that &#x27;nerdos&#x27; is more powerful than &#x27;thymos&#x27; — and playfully claim the Greeks feared it, the Middle Ages banned it, and that the devil truly does hide in the details.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">If something is worth doing for free, it’s worth doing nerd-out obsessively-compulsively for free.<br>
<br>
“Free” implies the purest kind of surplus leisure energy. It should be unshackled from ordinary ROI thinking. You’ve <strong>already</strong> accepted zero returns. So why hold back?</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I don’t mean doing it with excellence. Excellence only applies to non-free things. It’s a point on a price performance curve. <br>
<br>
True free things (not free samples or loss leaders or freemium or charity) don’t belong on that curve.<br>
<br>
Nerd-OCD = qualitatively absurd level of caring.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Anybody who would only do something comparable for money should react like “I wouldn’t put that much effort into this if I were being paid a million dollars”<br>
<br>
Money cannot but nerd-OCD levels of caring about a thing. In fact it will discourage it. You’d be caring too much.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Note that we’re NOT talking talent, genius, or exceptional intelligence being inputs. Only demented, quixotic levels of caring, and irrationally absurd levels of time/attention investment but with perfectly ordinary abilities.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This is why most examples are from things like fan theories or hobby projects. Domains where talent is not expected, ROI-logic is suspended by default, and the work is its own reward.<br>
<br>
Labor of love stuff, but love is the wrong word.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Psychologically what’s going on is that you’ve triggered a network effect in your head that generates seemingly limitless reserves of attention and engagement with the subject. That’s nerd-OCD. You become a perpetual motion machine of sorts.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">The Greeks called it “nerdos” and feared it. It’s where we get the word “nerd.” 🤓<br>
<br>
They feared it because they knew it was more powerful than “thymos” and will-to-power 😎<br>
<br>
That’s why they tried to ban it. Nerdos was viewed as devil energy in the Middle Ages.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">That’s why we have sayings like “the devil hides in the details” or “an idle mind is the devil’s workshop.” <br>
<br>
Religious fear of ocd-nerd energy that trashes ROI formulas, the concept of money, and the supposed value of striving for recognition in thymos contests.</div>
