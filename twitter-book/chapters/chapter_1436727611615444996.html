  <div class="tweet-text">There’s also been a shift from stock to flow. Committees and councils are relatively strongly persistent bodies in membership terms. You have to be appointed or voted in.

  <div class="tweet-text">There’s usually a correlation to budgets or permissions.

  <div class="tweet-text">“Stuck in committee” used to be a thing everywhere, now it’s mainly a government thing. It was a peculiar kind of stuckness since certain decisions could only be made by empowered committees which only met on a schedule, with a formal agenda you had to get on.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">In modern managerial culture if a thing needs action fast, you flag it for a sufficiently empowered individual manager who just makes the call.

  <div class="tweet-text">Clearly this is both a faster OODA loop and a more agile one (reorients faster with fast transients), which is why satrapy-stack companies outcompeted committee stack companies comprehensively for 30 years.

  <div class="tweet-text">Since I’ve been learning a bit about radiation hardened electronics for the @yakrover project, an analogy occurs to me. Committee structure is radiation-hardened org structure. It’s 20 years behind on performance… but it can function in outer space.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">For eg Perseverance operates on 1998 vintage radhard chips while the Ingenuity helicopter runs on unhardened modern chips. But Percy is both more mission critical, and unlike Ingenuity, also had to run compute during the Earth-Mars journey in open space.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">I have no idea why this is on my mind 🤔<br>
<br>
Another analogy. Committee vs satrapy structure is like oak tree vs bamboo strategy for resistance to strong winds. Oak trees will resist rigidly up to a point, but when they topple they’re done. No fast regrowth. Bamboo is the opposite.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet" id="t1436739593223610376">

  <div class="tweet-text">Modern stuff is 100% bamboo, in part thanks to Japanese methods. Quick fail/fast regrowth under stress maps to how andon cords and minimizing mean time to recovery (MTTR) work. Oak tree is maximizing mean time between failures (MTBF). Today they are Good and Evil respectively.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Aside: strikes me as weird that Japan, which we tend to think of as a conformist culture, was where this essentially individual-agency style of management emerged. An individual decides to pull the andon cord. An individual supervisor is responsible for acting. Samurai culture?</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">But… did we throw out some baby with bath water along the way? <br>
<br>
The lean vs fat tradeoff in supply chains is an obvious dimension where we’re doing a double take. Are there other dimensions? Are there regimes where maxMTBF is better than minMTTR?<br>

Americans making a fundamental attribution error and the Japanese flattering that conceit.

  <div class="tweet-text">The decisive factor in what I’ve been calling satrapy culture is chains of individual accountability for outcomes. What agile types call “single wringable neck” but in a stack from janitor to CEO. Committees otoh follow the principle of collective, procedural accountability.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Satrapies are consequentialist: was the outcome good or bad? If bad, who in the accountability chain fucked up? In Japan that person would be expected to put on a self-abasement apology show for the whole company but wouldn’t be fired unless it was an egregious moral failure.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">In the US, there would be no apology theater, and that person would be more likely to be fired. And more likely would be a scapegoat rather than the real culprit.<br>

But either way, individual chain of accountability for <strong>outcomes</strong></div>

  <div class="tweet-text">A committee culture org is deontological ethics. Whether the outcome was good or bad is irrelevant. The question is, did the stack of collectively accountable committees follow due process, including escalations and exception handling? If not, which <strong>procedures</strong> are flawed?</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The assumption is, individuals do the right thing competently and if outcomes are bad, either it was just sheer bad luck or the procedures are wrong. Hence fact-finding committees. In this model, managers especially can never be wrong, only the procedures can be.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Even when individuals “fail” like “pilot error” the focus is on why the procedures didn’t build in protection against that pattern of error.<br>

All the decisive and risky intelligence is presumed to be in the system itself, not the heads of individuals.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">And yeah, DAOs are promising as a synthesis mode, but most people I hear rhapsodize about them seem to have zero experience managing anything of consequence with or without them, in either satrapy or committee mode. They’re code-happy. So I’m just observing for now.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">The core problem is psychological, social and epistemic. Not tech. Satrapies solve for special Great Man approaches and they mostly turn out to be ordinary egotists or have feet of clay. Committees solve for ordinary people approaches and stifle genuine greatness where it exists.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">My bias is towards ordinary because I think most people are ordinary, including me. The percentage of genuinely great people (either intrinsic or circumstantial) is overstated by a factor of 10,000x especially in the US. For every Steve Jobs there are 9999 Elizabeth Holmeses.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">I’ll leave you with a factoid. There’s 2 collective nouns for geese. A gaggle is when they’re on the ground, a skein is when they’re in the air. In this case, it’s a useful distinction.</div>
