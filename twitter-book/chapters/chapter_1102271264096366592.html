        <h1 class="chapter-title">29. Risk vs. Depth</h1>
        <div class="chapter-subtitle">March 3, 2019</div>
        <div class="chapter-summary"><em>In which I confess that I have never truly learned anything non-physical through deliberate study — only through parasitic surfing of socially cached knowledge — and diagnose my thinking style as shallow right-brained arbitrage that trades depth for speed, with a one-context-at-a-time limit.</em></div>
        <div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Realizing I’ve never actually learned anything non-tactile/physical (like swimming or bike-riding) as a result of explicitly trying to learn it. It’s always been a side effect of something else (like reading for pleasure) or wanting to do or make something.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I do have what you might call “wild cousin” behaviors to disciplined learning. I repeat good stories I’ve heard. I put a lot of direct quotes and oblique references in my writing. I tend to think about everyday contemporary topics where relevant information is socially cached.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">All my explicit “study” habits suck. I don’t take notes, I rarely go “back to basics” to read foundational “classics”, I don’t do practice exercises unless they are like puzzles for fun (a criterion is satisfied by most math-based skills fortunately). I don’t learn “good form”</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This is a very lean, differential-diagnosis focused survivalist thinking style that basically surfs the learning already in the environment and/or embeddable in natural work output. A mediocre-small-brain style. It has strengths (speed being big one) but also serious blind spots.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This is not “making connections across fields” (which requires some depth in to/from fields. Nor is it playing “chess postman” which requires some careful systematic left-brained bridge building. It’s more like shallow right-brained arbitrage.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">At a macro level, everything I do is unapologetically, even gleefully derivative in some sense. Any value comes from the risk rather than skill or imagination. Eg: using The Office to interpret management theory, without being skilled at either screenwriting or textbook MBA stuff</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">...but I’ve never made or hacked anything requiring 2 stack layers. Eg full model plane with remote controls. Closest I came was a kit robot but I never got past a few hello-world programs that made it go around in circles. I quit when I couldn’t fix a simple coupled problem...</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I don’t think I ever made/hacked/repaired anything non-trivial more than 1 layer deep. For eg, I’ve built decently complex model gliders, rigged up electronics layer for stuff with existing hardware/software things, and fixed 1-factor issues (eg pure electrical or pure plumbing)</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Second, it doesn’t work on things that require skill stacks deeper than 2. An example is building hardware/software integrated things, which is at least about 3 layers deep (physical design, physical fabrication, software). This is an interesting one...worth a &lt;sidebar&gt;</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">First, it doesn’t work on topics that aren’t simultaneously being worked by lots of other people. Preferably focused types who are likely to miss obvious things that are in peripheral vision or first-order “irrelevant”. So you can’t do far out stuff being worked by like 5 people.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Implication: I only hold 1 context in head at a time and largely surf natural dynamics in that context intuitively, and by learning patterns of “luck”. Go to 2 contexts and intuition breaks, coupled 2-context good luck becomes unlikely, “normal accident” bad luck becomes likely</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Same story in software. Software has both stack levels (source, compiled, environment...) and lifecycle stages (dev/production). I’ve built complex single-level/single-stage things (Matlab basically) but go to 2, and I’ve never gotten beyond hello-world level complexity.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">If you’re curious, I couldn’t get wheel alignment perfect. So an open-loop straight line program would cause a slow turn. I’d have had to either true the steering, compensate in software or design and add a position feedback sensor loop... lost patience, gave up.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Sometimes you get really meta-lucky and see a really “long” single-context pathway cutting across multiple specialized stack levels/lifecycle stages. Like a wormhole through learning space. Any move you make in this wormhole context looks like magic to disciplined learners.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Example: sociology and management theory are pretty much the same. You need no context switching between them really, just some jargon mapping. Intuition and insight-luck patterns work in nearly seamless ways across them. Ignore the boundary and you’ll look like a genius.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">This is almost the definition of least-effort slacking. The one mitigating factor is that sometimes a context boundary that is taken seriously by others is not actually real so you can exploit a broader single context and seem like a holistic mind-like-water systems thinker.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">If you find this inspirational/aspirational at some level, curb your enthusiasm. It’s more curse than blessing. There’s something very unsatisfying about this, which is why every year or two I take a run at a “deeper” project that would come easier to disciplined learners.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">If I had to name this thinking/pseudo-learning style given its tricks, strengths, and weaknesses, it would probably be “parasitic”. Low-energy, low-effort, derivative survivalism. Like the grasshopper in ant and grasshopper story. <br>
<br>
Occasionally predatory rather than parasitic.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Third, it doesn’t work on things that take more time than social-cache-refresh time constants. For example, “blockchain” was in hive mind for a year, so I was having interesting thoughts about it. But serious work on blockchain takes 3+ yrs. So I’m recession-weak on the subject.</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">I <strong>think</strong> this is what looks like “strategic insight” (coup d’oeil) from the outside. It’s really a cheap exploit in the landscape of other people’s socially embodied institutional ways of knowing, due to improbable concurrences of insubstantial context boundaries. End &lt;/sidebar&gt;</div>



</div>
<div class="tweet">
  <div class="tweet-text">Hasn’t worked yet, but I’m optimistic I’ll eventually do at least one 2+ layer deep thing in my life that’s more than right-brained arbitrage/surfing or wormhole trickery of environmental learning.</div>
