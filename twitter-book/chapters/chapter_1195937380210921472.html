<blockquote class="quote-box"><div class="quote-text">I was briefly calling myself an independent researcher: somebody who self-funds spec R&amp;D on their own ideas. In theory it’s something like indie-research : academic research :: blogging/self-publishing : traditional publishing.<br>

  <div class="tweet-text">On one extreme you can think UBI, which is roughly ~ early grad student level $. <br>
<br>
On the other extreme, you could think of early career faculty grants.<br>
<br>
An NSF CAREER grant is 100k/year for 5 yrs, and in 2018, about 150 million was disbursed or about 300.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">A subset of ~20 get PECASE awards which push up the 100k to 500k/yr, sp that’s another 40 million. This 190 million basically supports 300 new faculty every year which I think is approximately ALL new faculty in say the top 25-30 universities.</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">At grad student stipend level, you’re talking about a quarter that. 25k/year. So you could support about 1200 grad student level researchers for the same amount. So $19- million gets you somewhere between 300 to 1200 bets on independent researchers. Now who can afford that?</div>

  <div class="tweet-text">Let’s look at Silicon Valley.  Last I checked, Series A, B, C, and D rounds are ~10 million, 20mm, 50mm, 100mm. Might be off by a bit.<br>

So... doubling research capacity of entire university system = 20 As, 10 Bs, 4 Cs, or 2 Ds.<br>
