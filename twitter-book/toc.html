Singles</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_559810543616135171.html">2. R. K. Laxman and Bearing Witness <span class="toc-date">(January 26, 2015)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I explore the concept of bearing witness, and its relationship to the ethics of citizenship, with reference to the legendary cartoonist R. K. Laxman.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_655913909086384128.html">3. Antimanifestos <span class="toc-date">(October 19, 2015)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I develop the idea of an antimanifesto — a set of live contradictions you steer by, rather than settled beliefs you bury as habits — and argue that divergent exploration, driven by curiosity rather than social consensus, is the more honest posture.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_770722802957549568.html">4. Epsilon-Delta thinking <span class="toc-date">(August 30, 2016)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I push back on Peter Thiel&#x27;s &quot;zero to one&quot; framing by proposing epsilon-delta thinking — the calculus of small, continuous changes — as a richer model for navigating innovation and uncertainty than the discrete coin-flip logic of statistics.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_892791404853772288.html">5. Riff on Ambition <span class="toc-date">(August 2, 2017)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I propose measuring ambition in &quot;baby equivalents&quot; — open-ended commitments that, if successful, demand indefinite attention — and explore why we rationally lower our sights as we age, even when we&#x27;re not losing.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_896592058697175040.html">6. Healing the Wounds of History <span class="toc-date">(August 13, 2017)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that historical trauma works like financial debt — with compound interest — and that the pain of figures like Robert E. Lee and Genghis Khan must be consciously experienced before it can be retired, not buried under clever thinking or false enlightenment.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_915302752720322560.html">7. Boundary Intelligence <span class="toc-date">(October 3, 2017)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I propose a two-element theory of intelligence — boundary versus interior — and argue that what you let hit your attention matters far more than how you process it, once you clear a minimum competence bar. Picking which table to sit at beats poker skill every time.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_917483373068673024.html">8. Unboxing in Unbundling <span class="toc-date">(October 9, 2017)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I explore the hidden costs of software-driven unbundling by focusing on the &quot;box&quot; — the institutional container — and argue that when you unbox organizations into networks, critical meta-functions like sustainability and indirect cost support don&#x27;t magically re-emerge for free.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_987356495640539136.html">9. On Online Teaching <span class="toc-date">(April 20, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I reflect on teaching in the free-agent world, distinguish between undergrad-style service courses and &quot;Weird Topics&quot; grad seminars, and conclude that the interesting frontier is building an indie teaching scene — not disrupting universities but occupying the long tail they can&#x27;t reach.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_991008095819059200.html">10. Big Skies, Big Cities <span class="toc-date">(April 30, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I push back on James Fallows&#x27; &quot;Little Sky Country&quot; optimism by arguing that America&#x27;s strength has always been Hamiltonian — big cities, large-scale collaboration, mass manufacturing — and that 100,000 flourishing small towns don&#x27;t add up to a Big Sky solution.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1010379160810708992.html">11. Borders and Bridges <span class="toc-date">(June 23, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I reframe borders as social-graph transformation functions rather than dams against human floods, argue that refugee communities are arks of cultural capital rather than sources of chaos, and suggest that America&#x27;s one-sided immigration mythology blinds it to the real richness of migration.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1047925106423603200.html">12. Against Waldenponding (original) <span class="toc-date">(October 4, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue against Waldenponding — the urge to unplug from information streams — by proposing that you are a node in a giant social computer, that FOMO is functional, and that the real skill is strength-training your attention to move fluidly between shitposting and philosophy.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1056603055309778944.html">13. Thinking for Yourself <span class="toc-date">(October 28, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I define genuine independent thinking as consistently reaching conclusions that are different, surprising, and significant — using an extended driving metaphor where nerve, not intelligence, is what lets you overtake on the straights rather than just follow the turns.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1059210078262190081.html">14. Bonus Mentality <span class="toc-date">(November 4, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I unpack the maker&#x27;s dilemma — how discovered elegance in creative work gets systematically undervalued by hindsight — and propose a &quot;bonus mentality&quot; of parlaying unexpected insights into spillover value rather than obfuscating the simplicity or eating the loss.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1068240511717171200.html">15. On Mysteries <span class="toc-date">(November 29, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I develop a theory of mysteries as potential ontological debts or credits — drawing on Holmes, Dirk Gently, and Occam — and argue that a healthy worldview requires constant creative destruction of its primitives, firing both overworked gods and underperforming dogs from your ontology.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1068336253827858432.html">16. Agency in the Developing World <span class="toc-date">(November 30, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that developing-world squalor paradoxically preserves a rough equality of agency — what I call &quot;suckagency&quot; — while the developed world trades individual agency for comfort via an ever-expanding social contract, and that both are converging toward a software-eaten &quot;second world.&quot;</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1069657064937418752.html">17. On Being Forgotten <span class="toc-date">(December 3, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I trace the American sense of being &quot;forgotten&quot; to the dismantling of Jacksonian spoils-based clientelism by neoliberalism&#x27;s meritocratic looting regime — arguing that cultural majorities lost their institutional affirmative action, not their narrative spotlight, and resent accordingly.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1071889268904157184.html">18. External vs. Internal Locus of Control <span class="toc-date">(December 9, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I complicate the standard theory of locus of control by arguing that external-locus people run hot — not helpless — and that managing their explosive, outward-directed energy is the central unsolved problem of institutional design, from entrepreneurship to societal meltdowns.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1074493715983388672.html">19. The only liberal move is not to play <span class="toc-date">(December 17, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that the most powerful liberal move against illiberalism is simple non-participation — saying &quot;I&#x27;ll take the next one&quot; — because totalizing ideologies feed on growth like Ponzi schemes, while pluralist ones can sustain themselves at any scale, even sub-singleton.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1074822050139656192.html">20. Crackpot Metaphysics <span class="toc-date">(December 18, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I share my backstage crackpot metaphysics — a poiesis-to-praxis spectrum measure for thought, mapped onto a triangle visualization — where every thought can be plotted by how far it sits from pure self-expression versus pure worldly engagement, riffing on Hannah Arendt&#x27;s vita activa.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1074890050213621760.html">21. Judge them by their topics <span class="toc-date">(December 18, 2018)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that thinkers should be judged by their choice of topic rather than their method — because risky topics carry moral hazard, sloppy errors flow downhill toward the vulnerable, and &quot;just asking questions&quot; on explosive subjects without extra care is the intellectual equivalent of a normal accident in a nuclear reactor.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1080011520229048320.html">22. Rules of Social Media Engagement, 2019 <span class="toc-date">(January 1, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I lay out personal rules of social media engagement for 2019 — arguing that reach is a pick-two-of-three between fast, cheap, and good, and that building slow, for-life relationships beats the temptation of edgy fast-and-cheap tribal warfare every time.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1082339743335997440.html">23. The Nutrition Transition <span class="toc-date">(January 7, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I draw a parallel between the energy transition and what I call the Nutrition Transition — arguing that plant-based food technology will eventually do for factory farming what renewables are doing for fossil fuels, with functional substitution all the way down to atoms and joules.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1087186955467554816.html">24. Design for Mediocrity <span class="toc-date">(January 21, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I mount a defense of mediocrity as the psychic safety net of civilization — arguing that democratization is mediocratization, that humans choose sociability over exceptionalism, and that waging war on the ordinary produces not excellence but homelessness and madness.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1088328519652827136.html">25. Killing People to Reboot Things <span class="toc-date">(January 24, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I use the example of air traffic control to argue that many libertarian end-states may be &quot;collapse complete&quot; — achievable only by burning civilization down first — and that the BTFSTTG mindset of deliberately breaking things to reboot them is sadism dressed as ideology.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1090348697831976960.html">26. Snobby Holmesean Cases with Singular Features <span class="toc-date">(January 29, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I confess to growing Holmesian about consulting work — requiring &quot;singular features&quot; in a case to take it on — and reflect on the fact that 90% of business problems are boring after the third time, and the real test of entrepreneurship is the courage to endure years of that boredom.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1091792315025215488.html">27. Blue Collar Innovation <span class="toc-date">(February 2, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I describe the &quot;blue-collar innovator mutual-influence network&quot; — the phase between pioneers and institutions where overqualified people get their hands dirty with emerging tools, freely stealing tricks from each other — as the most energizing and consequential stage of any innovation revolution.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1097233846444089344.html">28. Fractals, Foxes, and Hedgehogs <span class="toc-date">(February 17, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that fractal realities break both foxes and hedgehogs — hedgehogs by reducing everything to rice, foxes by freezing in the face of irreducible variety — and that the only way through is scale-free recursive thinking, which human brains are frustratingly bad at.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1102271264096366592.html">29. Risk vs. Depth <span class="toc-date">(March 3, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I confess that I have never truly learned anything non-physical through deliberate study — only through parasitic surfing of socially cached knowledge — and diagnose my thinking style as shallow right-brained arbitrage that trades depth for speed, with a one-context-at-a-time limit.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1103524374374580225.html">30. The Cosmic Mirror Test <span class="toc-date">(March 7, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I propose the &quot;cosmic mirror test&quot; — do you feel lonely when you look up at the stars? — as a marker for what I call the Gaia instinct, and argue that what climate change truly threatens is not life itself but the soul-sustaining capacity to identify with all of it.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1108580125061181442.html">31. Seen-It-All Syndrome <span class="toc-date">(March 21, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I diagnose &quot;seen-it-all syndrome&quot; — the plateau where genuine surprise becomes scarce by age 35-50 — and argue that the cure is not picking up unrelated hobbies but self-disrupting where you already have mastery, surrendering agency long enough to let the universe surprise you again.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1112446020015710208.html">32. Turing-Complete Identities <span class="toc-date">(March 31, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I connect the end of history to identitarian consensus — when everyone agrees what boxes everyone is in — and argue that restarting history requires not simple role-swaps but Turing-complete narrative mutations, where characters and worlds evolve together in irreversible entanglement.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1123260313875374080.html">33. Asking Questions <span class="toc-date">(April 30, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that the most valuable thing you can do in your twenties is not grind on age-old questions everyone has always asked but find new questions few people are asking — even trivial-seeming ones — because novelty never wears its significance on the cover.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1158049104355704832.html">34. Wealth/Success Monoculture in the US <span class="toc-date">(August 4, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I diagnose America&#x27;s wealth-and-success monoculture — where you must either idolize or demonize the rich — as the root of its collective mental health crisis, noting that it contaminates every life script and renders the country incapable of thinking clearly about healthcare, climate, or compassion.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1175999844101439488.html">35. Memory Genres <span class="toc-date">(September 23, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I survey six genres of cultural memory — from autobiography to participant history — and predict that all are breaking down into a diffraction pattern of non-consensus, revisionist histories where no canonical point of view can hold, and the log level shall reign supreme.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1179977624635895808.html">36. Mock Shocks and Rube Revelations <span class="toc-date">(October 4, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I coin &quot;rube revelation&quot; as the opposite of mock shock — when someone sincerely believes they are speaking radical truth but is merely belaboring the obvious — and argue that cascades of such revelations, weaponized by cynical elites, are the engine of conspiracy epistemology and digital Maoism.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1195789557465153536.html">37. On Independent Research <span class="toc-date">(November 16, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I confess that &#x27;independent researcher&#x27; was a conceit, argue that real R&amp;D requires either tenure or wealth — citing Wolfram, Hawkins, and Carmack as proof — and rank research activities on a 1-to-10 scale of riskiness, concluding that software has not eaten R&amp;D because the bottleneck is time, not tools.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1195937380210921472.html">38. On Independent Research II <span class="toc-date">(November 17, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I do the arithmetic on indie research funding — comparing NSF CAREER grants to Silicon Valley round sizes — and argue that private capital could easily triple U.S. research capacity if it stopped freeloading off the university system, with a nod to Vannevar Bush and the unbundling of the academy.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1205320897495625729.html">39. Threadapalooza 100 political opinions thread <span class="toc-date">(December 13, 2019)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I attempt to list 100 candid political opinions, one per like, ranging from &#x27;UBI is a bad idea&#x27; to &#x27;Gandalf was from Ravenclaw&#x27; — a threadapalooza exercise in proving that anyone claiming more than three real political opinions is making shit up for lulz.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1228108909484769280.html">40. Animals, Agency, and Accountability <span class="toc-date">(February 14, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I riff on medieval animal trials and argue that modern political discourse has split humanity into two species — one held morally accountable, the other granted animal-level non-culpability — and suggest that real agency requires the capacity to surprise yourself and others.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1228449050967433217.html">41. The Economics of Dignity <span class="toc-date">(February 14, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I propose that dignity is an invisible economic variable — the gap between performed and felt composure — and argue that the central problem of our times is pricing in the cost of humiliation, from Mark Cuban&#x27;s air guitar demand to waiters spitting in your food.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1230182790882181122.html">42. Quality Control vs. Quality Selection <span class="toc-date">(February 19, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I distinguish quality control from quality selection, argue that creative stall recovery requires the counterintuitive move of lowering your standards and diving — using the MCU&#x27;s bet on second-string properties as proof — and confess I&#x27;m trying to talk myself into exactly that.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1256739322780241921.html">43. The Financial Lensing Effect <span class="toc-date">(May 3, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I coin the &#x27;financial lensing effect&#x27; — large concentrations of capital bending truth and warping epistemology like gravitational lensing — and argue that the economy is a powerful distributed computer tragically programmed by its dullest, richest users, with reference to Alberto Moravia.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1272186524369424385.html">44. Learning as Rental over Ownership <span class="toc-date">(June 14, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I liken most learning to renting an apartment rather than buying one — you pay to live in the knowledge for a while, then leave with only a map of addresses — and argue for a wabi-sabi, kintsugi attitude toward the natural lossiness of what we know.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1277262959828283392.html">45. Two Kinds of Investing <span class="toc-date">(June 28, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I distinguish investing-to-build from investing-to-own-a-stake, argue that financialization is rooted in the laziness of the rich, compare capital&#x27;s ADHD to a hypothetical where all genes jump into the horniest rabbits, and confess to being a petit bourgeois vertical centrist.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1277760202951897089.html">46. Bullshit Jobs and Culture Wars <span class="toc-date">(June 30, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I identify four evolutionary stages of bullshit jobs — automation, outsourcing, trumpification, and wokification — warn that culture war is now the number one consulting problem, and predict that the enterprise world circa 2024 will look like the internet of beefs circa 2017.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1277996104915619841.html">47. On Grifts <span class="toc-date">(June 30, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I define a grift as a scheme that profits from a real problem without addressing it, distinguish it from scams and cons via Erving Goffman, introduce the concept of &#x27;problem aestheticization,&#x27; and admit that my own pretty turns of phrase are a mild form of the disease.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1279532354499821568.html">48. Taking Things Seriously <span class="toc-date">(July 4, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that 90% of effectiveness is just taking a thing seriously enough — wanting the thing itself rather than psychologically adjacent side effects — and that motivation is a learnable skill of locking emotion to precise verbal goals, with a nod to Herrigel&#x27;s Zen archery.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1297743621777580034.html">49. The Perils of Uncalibrated Brains <span class="toc-date">(August 24, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I diagnose the epidemic of uncalibrated brains — people who lack institutional benchmarks for their own thinking — and argue that the internet&#x27;s Cambrian explosion of consensus realities is 99% one-eyed-leading-blind tribes, with calibration against non-human, non-textual reality as the only cure.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1302083532022362112.html">50. Beliefverse <span class="toc-date">(September 5, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I propose that belief is not an individual mental state but a relational one — a multiverse of micro-realities you can only enter with others — and develop a quantum-mechanics metaphor where doubt is the live state, belief the dead, and cults are deep entanglement gravity wells.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1305573930334208000.html">51. Uncertainty Regulation as a Basic Drive <span class="toc-date">(September 14, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I hypothesize that &#x27;regulate uncertainty&#x27; is a basic drive alongside pleasure-seeking and pain-avoidance, explore my own preference for improv over planning as uncertainty management, and argue that the three grand strategies are spend more, do less, or think harder — only the last keeping life interesting.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1307846068445478913.html">52. Nerdos vs Thymos <span class="toc-date">(September 21, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that if something is worth doing for free, it&#x27;s worth nerding out on obsessively — that &#x27;nerdos&#x27; is more powerful than &#x27;thymos&#x27; — and playfully claim the Greeks feared it, the Middle Ages banned it, and that the devil truly does hide in the details.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1309988191114416128.html">53. Societies Evolve to Normalize Psychopathic Self-Presentation <span class="toc-date">(September 26, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I entertain the hypothesis that civilization doesn&#x27;t teach psychopaths to fake good manners but rather evolves to normalize psychopathic charm as the standard for polite behavior — that sufficiently advanced sociopathy is indistinguishable from good manners, per Kim Scott&#x27;s Radical Candor grid.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1310692412537225217.html">54. Modernism as Aliveness to Change <span class="toc-date">(September 28, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I search for a verb meaning &#x27;doing science&#x27; stripped of institutional baggage, land on &#x27;modernism as aliveness to change,&#x27; and argue that the scientific sensibility is less about intelligence than about patient, instrument-aided attention to the present — with a side note that early scientists were rightly also astrologers.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1314983875546767362.html">55. Caring About Money <span class="toc-date">(October 10, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I observe that caring about money past your personal anxiety threshold is a genuine superpower, distinguish &#x27;dead money&#x27; from &#x27;live money&#x27; that buys Monday-morning leisure, and argue that true freedom begins where income decouples from effort-reward recipes.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1316168198866132992.html">56. Doing Only 1 Thing <span class="toc-date">(October 14, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I declare that prioritization is the communism of attention management, confess I can only bootstrap one fresh orientation per day, and explore why Covid&#x27;s elimination of third places has robbed me of the location changes that used to supply second winds.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1319819179491381248.html">57. Long-Term Thinking https://t.co/C07axDIO9R <span class="toc-date">(October 24, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that long-term thinking makes people unhappy because big problems reliably persist, that general capabilities reshape but never solve specific problems, and that mediocre people should focus on non-misery at each life stage — because if you&#x27;re miserable and not a Chosen One, you&#x27;re part of the problem.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1322666563107917824.html">58. Wealth and Protocols <span class="toc-date">(October 31, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I use the metaphor of handshake protocols and impedance matching to argue that social harmony is only possible within a narrow logarithmic band of wealth and power, illustrating with the Friends dinner-check scene — and that most culture war problems are misdiagnosed protocol failures, not moral ones.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1330917074500141057.html">59. Occupying Both Sides of a Conversation <span class="toc-date">(November 23, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I dissect the universal tendency to script both sides of a conversation — Procrustean beds all the way down — and describe my consulting method of testing whether clients actually listened in free-play mode, because hearsay of scripted conversations is just noise.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1331673021367480320.html">60. Good World-Building Needs Peacocking <span class="toc-date">(November 25, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that great genre fiction centers an unnecessarily overbuilt &#x27;non-basic element&#x27; — Tolkien&#x27;s languages, Culture ship names, Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide entries — that functions as the id of the world, a costly signal of authorial abundance that invites fan participation and spawns fanpedias.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1338215386416701441.html">61. Data Model Personhood <span class="toc-date">(December 13, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I propose &#x27;data model personhood&#x27; — that sufficiently complex data streams become virtual persons who should own themselves, like biological offspring — and wonder whether I myself might be a data-ghost of multiple beings who merely thinks it&#x27;s one person, a la Thomas Nagel&#x27;s bat.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1343975213424250881.html">62. Overactive Cheater Detection <span class="toc-date">(December 29, 2020)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that overactive cheater detection is at the root of most societal dysfunction — our ape-troop instincts firing wildly in a high-abundance world — and propose a five-strikes heuristic for non-scarcity societies, because the main cost of most cheating is the outraged overreaction to it.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1347225989017788419.html">63. Greedy Benefit-of-Doubt Allocation <span class="toc-date">(January 7, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that the original sin of a complex world is claiming all benefit of doubt for yourself, distinguish bold risk-taking from corrupt certainty-projection, and propose a golden rule: perform the actual uncertainty you feel — with reference to Goffman&#x27;s &#x27;cooling the mark out&#x27; and Taleb&#x27;s halo-effect posturing.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1350300376205938688.html">64. Aesthetics as the Entry Drug of Conservatism <span class="toc-date">(January 16, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I propose that aesthetics is the entry drug of conservatism — that prioritizing beauty above all else leads inevitably toward tradition — and illustrate with a cookie parable in which my wife fusses over perfection while I happily eat Chips Ahoy, arriving at what I call my garbage cookie manifesto.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1356011401458851841.html">65. Derelict Personhood <span class="toc-date">(January 31, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I meditate on scenes of derelict personhood — homeless people whose consciousness has retreated past the trash/not-trash boundary — argue via Maslow that you can only help someone at level N if they exist at level N+1, and wonder whether hyperdimensional aliens see me sitting in an 11-dimensional pile of trash.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1360037779766267906.html">66. Cancel Culture vs Know-Your-Place Culture <span class="toc-date">(February 12, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that the real alternative to cancel culture is not civil debate but know-your-place culture — the policing mechanism that cultural vacuums default to — drawing on Pareto&#x27;s circulation of elites, Hindi cinema&#x27;s patriarch slap, and the observation that when you&#x27;re used to privilege, equality feels like oppression.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1369517402623406081.html">67. Stakes vs. Costs <span class="toc-date">(March 10, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I distinguish stakes from costs via Sayre&#x27;s law — arguing that our era&#x27;s viciousness stems from historically low stakes, not high costs — and propose that technologies like crypto, Mars rovers, and stories exist to raise the stakes enough to make hard problems worth solving, because pain avoidance alone cannot supply meaning.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1387483328517840897.html">68. Self-Disruption <span class="toc-date">(April 28, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I apply disruption theory to personal reinvention — arguing that self-disruption means serving a marginal part of your own vision, like a hobby, and letting the scope creep proceed until it transforms you, with early adoption of new mediums as the secret weapon.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1387985032594161666.html">69. Return on Risk <span class="toc-date">(April 30, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I ask what fraction of income is return on risk versus effort — and confess to being too clever for my own good, taking easy high-return bets that stunted inner growth, arriving at the counterintuitive conclusion that leisure and useless pursuits are the cure for cleverness.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1401038710817234947.html">70. Straussian Taste Bureaucracies <span class="toc-date">(June 5, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I coin the idea of Straussian taste bureaucracies — institutional art worlds that certify emptiness as art to calibrate their own hegemonic power, like the Emperor&#x27;s new clothes as a deliberate loyalty test — and argue for anarchic cultural production outside captured traditions.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1401253631073034241.html">71. Riff on Kata-Style Learning <span class="toc-date">(June 5, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I ask why engineering resists kata-style learning — unlike music or martial arts, engineering is stamp collecting in physics, with too many idiosyncratic components introducing new primitives to be spanned by any compact combinatorial drill — and tentatively declare all kata bullshit.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1403448693982863360.html">72. Scams Favor Vertical Integration <span class="toc-date">(June 11, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that scams favor vertical integration — because vertical structures enable stronger branding and differentiation aura, friendlier to grift — and predict a shift toward horizontal commerce as the 13-year vertical phase erodes into commodified trust-based competition.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1404264190131331075.html">73. Herzog-Veblen Principle <span class="toc-date">(June 14, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I formulate the Herzog-Veblen principle — that wildernesses are murderous but lazy, and visible effort marks you as food — applying it to the online world, where conspicuous hustling eventually makes you somebody&#x27;s lunch. The only safe place to work hard is in a cage.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1404594135261016067.html">74. The Rule of 5 <span class="toc-date">(June 15, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I propose a Rule of 5 for public discourse — praise or criticize in named groups of five, never archetypally — as a middle path between useless mob justice and inaccessible courtroom law, arguing that unstructured conflict resolution breaks down above nuclear-family scale.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1404688678568349705.html">75. Moar Trash-talking Singularitarianism <span class="toc-date">(June 15, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I trash-talk singularitarianism again — arguing that AGI is an eschatological motte-and-bailey, that clever people overestimate the cosmic importance of cleverness, and that the circularity of the smartest people worrying about superintelligence is a kind of anthropic narcissism.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1407009538218205189.html">76. Project managing network effects <span class="toc-date">(June 21, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I ask whether you can project-manage a network effect from a position of strength — connecting OODA loops, potential field theory, and seasonal harvest cycles into a speculative framework for top-down catalysis of emergent dynamics in controlled networks.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1407355631267319810.html">77. Anti-network effects <span class="toc-date">(June 22, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I define anti-network effects using a cauliflower as my central metaphor — contrasting topology-aware recursive chopping with grid-dicing that destroys network structure — connecting this to legibility, Deleuze, max-flow min-cut, and authoritarian high modernism.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1421268674313220102.html">78. Charismatic Epistemologies <span class="toc-date">(July 31, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I develop the idea of charismatic epistemologies — how outlier success creates self-validating reality distortion fields that make you right a lot locally but cancerously wrong when extended beyond your zone — with reference to Zaphod Beeblebrox, Amazon, and my own mediocrity as vaccine.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1425589397055938563.html">79. True Names and Cantor-Slashing Intersectionality <span class="toc-date">(August 12, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I use Cantor diagonalization and prime numbers as metaphors for irreducible identity — arguing that intersectionality strengthened what it should have subverted, that humans should aspire to be like primes rather than factorable composites, and that the Perfect Joke addresses True Names.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1432390185182920713.html">80. Vegetarian Meal-Presentation <span class="toc-date">(August 30, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that vegetarian cuisine is fundamentally parallel and random-access while meat is serial and hub-spoke — exploring why Western plating fails vegetarian food, how Indian thali and Ethiopian injera get it right, and the mise-en-place improv of non-meat-centered eating.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1436727611615444996.html">81. Committees vs. Satrapies <span class="toc-date">(September 11, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I compare committee-based organizations to satrapy-based ones — consequentialist accountability chains versus deontological procedural cultures — using analogies from radiation-hardened chips, oak-versus-bamboo resilience, and Mughal decline to argue we need a synthesis of both.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1440741569083023361.html">82. Moral Curiosity <span class="toc-date">(September 22, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I distinguish moral curiosity from moral clarity — arguing that genuine leaders experiment at scale with moral questions rather than issuing manifestos, and that the DNA of any top-level leader is a specific ordering of tech, money, and moral curiosities.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1441465415213858830.html">83. Information Work Lotteries <span class="toc-date">(September 24, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I observe that sufficiently advanced information work is indistinguishable from a lottery ticket — the more abstract and indirect the work, the more uncertain its value — and apply this to writing, tweeting, middle management, and my own hobby rover-building.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1449765580995584007.html">84. Crackpottery is Impedance-Mismatched Rigor <span class="toc-date">(October 17, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I defend Myers-Briggs and Strauss-Howe over Big Five personality science — arguing that crackpottery is impedance-mismatched rigor, that being wrong about the right things beats being precise about dubious constructs, and that empirical noise cannot resolve ontological ambiguity.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1452526475366727682.html">85. On Surrender <span class="toc-date">(October 25, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I trace the invention of religious surrender from Bronze Age bicameral voices to axial age monotheism — via Jaynes, Dune&#x27;s ornithopter scene, and fossil fuels — concluding that secular meaning crises need material surrender options, and machine learning may be the next one.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1461544106371342337.html">86. Rereading Asimov <span class="toc-date">(November 19, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I close-read Asimov&#x27;s Empire and Robot novels across multiple rereads — appreciating his cut-to-insight world-building over aesthetic luxuriance, his unconscious seed-planting across decades, and arguing that Asimoverse is a greater achievement in extended-universe construction than Middle Earth.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1475525176875905025.html">87. Big Frontiers <span class="toc-date">(December 27, 2021)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I define Big Frontier as when it is cheaper to experiment than to determine if something is a scam — arguing that intelligence is maladaptive on rich frontiers, that the biggest risk in cores is being scammed while the biggest risk in frontiers is not playing, and that frontiers function as random-amnesia machines for social mobility.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1381087092147593216.html">88. Efficient Storytelling <span class="toc-date">(January 1, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I note that screen-era storytelling has gotten brutally efficient — lean narrative with no wasted beats, like amygdala assembly programming — citing Cobra Kai, The Expanse, and Stranger Things as examples of a mannerist late stage that may be on the cusp of disruption.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1508147225729273856.html">89. Experts Trilemma <span class="toc-date">(March 27, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I present the expert&#x27;s trilemma — express doubt and get lynched now, express false certainty and get lynched later, or ride one lucky contrarian call into a grifter career — and argue that genuine expertise is the capacity for systematic doubt, not trafficking in certainties.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1511497620958580738.html">90. Curiosity vs Interest <span class="toc-date">(April 6, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I distinguish curiosity from interest — curiosity is pre-valuation exploration of objects, interest is post-valuation attachment to subjects — arguing that curiosity is positive-sum while interest is zero-sum, and that feeding only your curiosities will take care of your interests.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1514631799418212355.html">91. Keep Twitter Mediocre <span class="toc-date">(April 14, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I respond to Musk&#x27;s Twitter bid by arguing that Twitter is a football stadium, not a public square — that free speech rhetoric masks a speech-reach conflation — and defend mediocrity against Fear of Being Ordinary, casting both Woke and NRx as twin denials of ordinariness.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1519343096940564481.html">92. Against Chosen Ones <span class="toc-date">(April 27, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I read Musk&#x27;s Twitter takeover through Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Sourcery — where a Chosen One wizard breaks the balance of power — and extract Discworld&#x27;s capital-T Theme: there are no main characters, only characters, and the infinite game needs constant protection from those who believe they are specially chosen.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1521566232649998337.html">93. The Fellowship Life <span class="toc-date">(May 3, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I reflect on the fellowship life — the circuits of think-tank sinecures, residencies, and institutional parasitism — confessing that my PhD has been an absurd passport, that steady income enables longer works, and that I am coasting on institutional fossil fuel from an earlier life.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1529870394034794499.html">94. Step by Step <span class="toc-date">(May 26, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I tag an emerging step-by-step ethos — from prompt engineering to backflip tutorials to Wordle — as the antidote to vibing, derangement, and brute-force trial-and-error, arguing that mindful sequentialism may be the tortoise that outruns the hare at civilizational scale.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1540000084745547776.html">95. Construct Essentialism <span class="toc-date">(June 23, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I critique construct essentialism — the linguistic power grab of replacing natural-kind terms with deconstructed feature descriptions — through analogies to fine dining menus, the milk wars, and the lump-of-humanism fallacy, arguing that defaults are inevitable efficiencies, not oppression.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1543270051330920450.html">96. Barbarous Ancestors <span class="toc-date">(July 2, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I call the Founding Fathers exceptionally mediocre thinkers — citing Jefferson&#x27;s own self-description as a barbarous ancestor — and argue that constitutional originalism is fragile nerd fandom propping up a short document with astounding exegetical overhead, like Windows on DOS.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1556176785322086401.html">97. Explainerism vs. Inventoryism <span class="toc-date">(August 7, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I distinguish explainerism from inventoryism — explainer journalism thrives within established categories but fails at ontological boundaries where new things come into being — and propose inventoryism as the opposite: groping in the dark where explainerism shines its confident but shrinking light.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1558870438393982977.html">98. Hypercomplexity <span class="toc-date">(August 15, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I coin hypercomplexity — systems so vast and heterogeneous they deserve a fat Robert Caro book — using Peter Jackson&#x27;s LOTR production as exhibit A, marveling at the breadth-first architectural intelligence required to wrangle thousands of moving parts across dozens of modes simultaneously.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1572217871803256832.html">99. Bureaucracy is Good, Actually <span class="toc-date">(September 20, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I make the contrarian case for bureaucracy — its essential Tao is ensuring work never flows backwards, overengineering outputs so nothing returns to your desk — arguing that forward-only accretion is a legitimate survival strategy, that the Jedi are a bureaucracy, and that Lindy vindication trumps startup ideology.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1577348895029370880.html">100. Risk Larping <span class="toc-date">(October 4, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that the fewer risks you take, the easier it is to be judgmental — that nobody can see the whole societal risk surface, that scripts harden distortions into judgmentalism, and that a shifting ideology is a necessary signal of genuine risk-taking rather than degen yield farming.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1584250758110752768.html">101. On the Power of Weekly Time Commitments <span class="toc-date">(October 23, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I extol the power of one hour per week committed indefinitely — arguing it beats intensive full-time bursts for compound learning, favors older people with time-abundance mindsets, and produces show-up sticky systems that evolve like spaced-repetition learning and water carving canyons.</span></li><li class="toc-item toc-thread has-tooltip"><a href="chapters/chapter_1590452854317514752.html">102. Larger Concentrations of Money are Dumber <span class="toc-date">(November 9, 2022)</span></a><span class="toc-tooltip">In which I argue that larger concentrations of money are dumber — each additional order of magnitude adds a layer of abstraction vulnerable to bullshit theories — and that the most effective deployment strategy is to fragment wealth to the smallest scale the problem physics will allow.</span></li></ul>
