Note on Production

    This book represents about 2% of my twitter posts (3,175 out of over 150,000), and is about 119,000 words long. The in-progress print version will weigh in at approximately 350–400 pages.

    It was produced in two phases, using AI-assisted tooling throughout. The initial pipeline—tweet normalization, thread extraction, and basic HTML generation—was built in conversation with ChatGPT (GPT-4) over several sessions in late 2025. The second phase, which added link title fetching, media embedding, endnotes, the Singles compendium redesign, navigation, mobile layout, social cards, and the typography overhaul, was built using Claude Code (Claude Opus). All editorial decisions—thread selection, chapter titles, the compendium curation, chapter summaries, and the preface—are the author’s own work, with AI used strictly as a programming collaborator rather than a content generator.

    The full source code, data pipeline, and build tooling are available on GitHub for those interested in the backstage process.

    This book is LLM-friendly. Point your LLM to venkateshrao.com/twitter-book if you want it to explore it. A full interactive archive, explorable via an AI oracle, is under development.

## Preface

Preface

  This book is an attempt to capture the essence of my 15 years as an active twitter user (I'm going to use the lowercase spelling except when referring to named subcultures within twitter), under the handle @vgr, in a form that does not entirely murder the spirit of the live experience of being there, enmeshed in hundreds of live-wire conversations unfolding over years, through an era when the platform was the place the narrative of our world unfolded. In the chapters that follow, you'll find a compendium of a few hundred of my best single tweets (Chapter 1), and 101 of my best threads (Chapters 2-102). That's a small fraction of the 150k+ tweets I posted through the years this book covers, but hopefully it's an interesting distillation. I'm still on there, though I mostly only browse the feed. I no longer post actively except for the rare boost of stuff I, or friends, are up to elsewhere.

   Through 2007-22, twitter was neither the biggest social media site, nor the most representative. But it was the most consequential place, not just on the internet, but arguably the planet. Entire political regimes rose and fell, careers were made and destroyed, vast cultural movements arose and died down. Other platforms may have featured more aggregate activity, and accumulated orders of magnitude more social dark matter, but twitter was where events broke into the main currents of history. The suburbs of reddit may have accumulated deep intelligence, but twitter was where some were promoted to historic consequentiality. Facebook ads and groups may have shaped elections, but twitter was where we collectively decided what it all meant. YouTube might have been where endless warrens of conspiratorial imaginaries were constructed, but twitter was where we determined which ones were going to shape the almighty Discourse. 4chan might have produced many world-changing memes, but twitter was where that world-changing actually played out.

  But twitter was more than a distribution zone for culture manufactured elsewhere. Increasingly, it became the site of cultural production. As a blogger who initially signed up to promote my posts on Ribbonfarm, I initially thought of it as a successor to RSS. Dumb pipes, just stochastic rather than deterministic. But it quickly became clear that was an absurdly bad mental model. Twitter was the tail that would come to wag the rest of the social-media dog. You can read my very early 2007-era understanding of twitter in this old blog post, The Twitter Zone and Virtual Geography. Now, nearly 20 years later, that mental model feels, not wrong per se (it was sophisticated for its time), but charmingly naive. What we thought was a low-stakes global office watercooler turned out to be the site of future epistemic world wars, in which the fates of civilizations would be decided.

  Speaking of the Discourse, that's what we inveterate, degenerate, Very Online people were there for. Hopelessly addicted to the almighty feed, and the dopamine hits of likes and retweets from our parasocial boos and senpais. And atop that milieu, the grand narrative of history could play out as powerfully as it did because the company's management through those critical years exhibited exactly the right level of public-sector style benign neglect and managerial ineptitude to allow unfettered and imaginative social intercourse to flourish. Twitter became the de facto town square of the world through those years because it was too big to properly manage except through benign neglect as a commons, even as it remained too small to turn a profit. In theory a small, haphazardly managed private corporation. In practice, a large public commons. The very strategic errors that prevented the company from realizing its obvious potential as a profit-making entity provided the affordances that made it such a wonderful space for a true public Discourse to take root.

  My early twitter years, approximately 2007-2013 or so, were rather unremarkable (and you'll note that there isn't much content from that period -- I've included a few of my earliest tweets as a prehistory section in Chatper 1, but they are clearly only of historical interest). During those years, the platform was sporadically the site of world-changing events (#iranelection being a prominent early example), but not home to the grand narrative of the world in any sense. Familiar features like @ replies and quote tweets were not yet officially supported. But by 2013 or so, the platform was nearly fully baked. Just in time for mainstream arrival with the American culture war in 2013, featuring such notable events as Gamergate, and the events in Ferguson, which led to movements like BLM and NRx leveling up politically. It was also during that period that various sectoral "twitters" took root. We had VC Twitter, EconTwitter, Black Twitter, and so forth.

  By 2015, the platform had become a variegated landscape of well-defined subcultures. Importantly, however, the platform remained what my old buddy Xianhang Zhang dubbed a plaza rather than a warren. The subncultural fragmentation did not acquire legible organization or destroy the one-big-public-square feel. This allowed thousands of illegible subcultures to flourish, such as Weird Sun twitter, and the mischievously vaguecronymed "UST" that grew around my old blogging comarade-in-arms on Ribbonfarm, Sarah Perry (UST supposedly stood for Unaffiliated Sloth Twitter, but nobody knows). Sarah was also the instigating figure around what came to be known as postrat twitter. Personally, I consciously stayed on the margins of these lively communities. During these middle years (roughly 2014-18), my blog Ribbonfarm was something like a insider's landmark for some of these subcultures. Many people I first met on twitter during these years went on to contribute to ribbonfarm, and participated in the meetups and annual event (Refactor Camp) I used to run during these years. By the time the late period began (roughly 2018 or so), however, the subcultural ferment had largely settled. Ossified, if still illegible, boundaries emerged. One notable and notorious subculture (partly a descendant of postrat twitter) that emerged towards the end of the middle years was tpot ("this part of twitter"). Ribbonfarm. primarily thanks to my long-time co-blogger Sarah Perry, became somewhat awkwardly retconned into the founding mythos of this subculture. I personally had (and have) many friends within tpot, but never saw myself as part of it. Largely because I felt I was a generation removed, as well as politically a world away. I suppose I was a sort of distant uncle to the scene.

  These middle years also saw the more legible and well-lit parts of twitter become increasingly prominent in the mainstream culture, as politicians, journalists, and business leaders realized that twitter was where the public first response to everything of consequence unfolded, generally days to weeks before it happened anywhere else. The part I was most associated with was probably Silicon Valley and VC/startup twitter. One event that radically altered my experience of twitter was briefly working with Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) during 2014-2015 at a16z (a gig I landed via Chris Dixon, @cdixon, via twitter). The influence was twofold. First, there was the direct influence. Being visibly associated with a huge account, through public banter, rapidly 3x-ed my following. I used to refer to the phenomenon as a "gravity assist." Second, Marc was responsible for perhaps the most consequential innovation on twitter during those years: the notorious tweetstorm,, which was the colorful term for what later got domesticated as the threading feature. When Marc first started tweetstorming, it was at once hugely entertaining and radically annoying at the same time, because his tweets would swamp and murder everybody's feeds. The platform quickly adapted and began to support a more usable threading UX, but for a while there, it was anarchy, as hundreds of others jumped into the tweetstorming game, myself included. Threading was a beautiful thing, allowing people to workshop complex arguments in real-time with a lively audience, in an unbundled form suitable for spawning rich comment threads and quote-and-fork side trails. I quickly became a huge fan of the format, despite its potential for being annoying. Not only did I start doing a lot of threads on twitter, I used the thread format in my newsletter for a while, and adapted it to serialized blogging in a format I called blogchains. Though Marc and I have since diverged politically, we remain on cordial terms at a personal level. And regardless of what you might think of him, history will definitely remember him for at least two remarkable inventions -- the browser, and the tweetstorm.

  No mention of threading culture is complete without a hat-tip to Visakan Veeraswamy, (@visakanv) of course. Visa took the basic linear threading idea pioneered by Marc and turned it into a dizzying artform, turning his account into a tangled, densely interlinked, quote-linked, promiscuously forking Lovecraftian monstrosity of a twitter hyperobject. I came up with a term for it: threadthulhu (my main contribution to culture through the twitter years was coming up with names for things). My own threadthulu was only middling crazy. Orderly enough that I was able to index all my good threads in a meta-thread over the years, and slaughter it relatively cleanly to create the raw material for this book. I doubt Visa's insane threadthulu can be killed at all, let alone properly butchered into a book-like echo like this one. I vibecoded the pipeline that created this book, but it will probably take AGI to similarly tame Visa's threadthulu. I kid of course. AGI is conceptual nonsense. Visa's threadthulu will remain forever untamed. If X dies, it will ascend into the latent spaces of various LLMs as an eternal monster.

  Threading culture reached its apogee with an event I had a hand in instigating, called Threadapalooza, in December 2019, where we all egged each other on to post 100-tweet monster threads. I think I got the idea because I was tired of seeing people complaining about long threads, and twitter being the transgressive place it was, the obvious thing to do was to annoy them more by instigating so many huge threads, you could drown out their whining. The event was huge fun, and went through a couple more annual iterations. It was one of the last times I truly had fun on twitter. Sadly, threading culture was later superseded by the significantly inferior screenshot essay form (no way to quote bite-sized fragments for dunking commentary or reply to a specific part of the idea easily), and eventually killed off entirely in favor of long posts by paying customers of Elon Musk's pay-to-play X. But before we get to that, perhaps a word or two on the cultural evolution of twitter up the change of ownership.

  The long arc of twitter's history as the site of the Discourse, roughly 2014-22, could be divided into 3 chapters:

  
    2013-2016: Hypomanic culture-chaos with a side of culture war -- a phase that ended with the death of Harambe.

    2016-2020: Internet of Beefs -- which began with the rise of Trump and ended with Covid. 

    2020-2022: Covid era -- which had very special characteristics and ended with the acquisition by Musk.

    
  

During the Internet of Beefs years, twitter gradually became less fun and more consequential. More and more people simply retreated, unable to handle the toxicity. One of my threads, included in this book, Against Waldenponding, captured my own arguments against retreating. That argument proved to be quite popular, and I think what happened next demonstrated why it was in fact correct. When Covid hit, in early 2020 (shortly after the first Threadapalooza iirc), it was twitter's time to absolutely shine. Twitter figured Covid out faster and better than any other public place on the planet, online or offline. And saved countless lives I suspect. I myself was able to react weeks ahead of most people in my non-twitter life. While some individuals, like Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis) played individually influential roles in triggering the effective early response, the truly impressive part was the way the wisdom of the crowds served as an accelerant. Every aspect of the pandemic got swarmed and figured out faster and better than anywhere else, so long as you were plugged into the right subcultures. Of course, there were also plenty of dumb subcultures getting things wildly wrong. I look back on twitter through the Covid years as humanity at its best in many ways. Though there was a great deal of toxicity and awfulness, there was also a remarkable amount of unprecedented positive power on display.

At the same time, there was no denying that the large-scale retreat was very real, and consequential. Whether or not I advocated staying plugged into the heady drug that was twitter, more and more of the most interesting people were choosing not to, and going dark. I first flagged this in a tweet of course:

Feb 6, 2019
Eff it, Yolo, I'm not waiting to see how Gen Z actually shapes up to tag them. Where's the fun in data-driven hindsight. I'm calling it early based on early markers and portents

If Millennials are Premium Mediocre...
Gen Z is gonna be Domestic Cozy

Yeah you heard it here first

I theorized and speculated about this trend more throughout 2019, on my blog and in newsletter, which also spawned one of my last major viral memes before the era of viral memes basically ended: the cozyweb

. The idea of the cozyweb later got incorporated into The Dark Forest Anthology of the Internet. Just before Covid hit, Tank magazine did a whole issue on the "cosy" turn, featuring an interview with me. In some ways, I think that interview marks the beginning of the end of my twitter journey. There's no point preaching against waldenponding when the entire zeitgeist decides to head in that direction. I think, if Covid hadn't interrupted, allowing twitter to enjoy an extended swan song final chapter, I suspect it would have degenerated into a boring backwater public square ignored by the Dark Forest era. Of course, that didn't happen. Covid did hit. It did radicalize a lot of moderates. And that radicalization did lead to what I dubbed the Muskening.

I decided to quit twitter pretty much the moment it became clear that the high farce of Elon Musk's acquisition bid would actually turn into reality. I documented my thinking and decision in a two-part essay series in my newsletter (Part 1, Part 2), so I won't bother rehashing that story here. Suffice it to say that things unfolded exactly as I expected, and I'm happy I went dark when I did. Some have since told me they think I was prescient in making a clean break and moving on so early, but there was no prescience involved. The writing on the wall was crystal clear to anyone willing to read it. I think what really made it an agonizing decision for many was leaving behind large followings and rich networks. Personally, I suffered zero agonies. Indifference to sunk costs is one of my core operating principles in life, and I've never had any regrets about walking away from seemingly priceless stores of social capital. I've walked away from many milieus, online and offline, and I'm sure I'll walk away from many more in the future. To the extent a ghost of twitter still exists, buried beneath the superficially familiar, but radically different beast that is X, I hang out enough as a silent reader to keep up with a few things (particularly robotics and AI news). But I have no desire to become an active part of the conversation or milieu there anymore, and largely tune it out. To Musk's credit, lately the For You feed appears to have picked up on my preferences and mostly shows me robotics tweets instead of ragebait. Maybe there's a slim chance of redemption yet, and those of you pining for the old twitter might yet see your hopes fulfilled. I have, frankly, moved on.

For some of you, this may be the first you're hearing from me in years. I think at least a few people on twitter have assumed I'm dead or retired. When I search for "@vgr"" or "ribbonfarm," which I do periodically (I have my little vanities), the results are mildly hilarious, like being at my own interminably extended funeral. An agonizingly drawn-out social death that I'm fortunately not there to actually suffer. These days, I mostly hang out on Substack Notes and Farcaster as far as public feeds go (I'm also on Bluesky, but not particularly active). But at 51, I find my appetite for the intensity of the public short-form game is slowly declining. So much of my attention and social energy now flows through a couple of Discords and Slacks, and a bunch of group chats. I don't think digital public spaces of the sort twitter represented for a few years are ever coming back. But while it existed, twitter was a once-in-history zone of pure magic. I'm glad I got to be part of it. No book-like artifact can ever capture even a fraction of that live magic, but I hope this one at least gives you some sense of what it was like for me, living, blogging and shitposting through those years.

## 1. Singles

A compendium of noteworthy standalone tweets, organized chronologically.

### 2007: Earliest Tweets

Pushing my cat away. When you give him wet food he wants dry, when you give him dry food he wants wet.

Hmm... just finished thorough read of Dan Pink's Free Agent Nation. Mull mull. Seinfeld on. Watch or mull more?

Darn, this twitter thing is neat. Only question is, do I want to pay for texting?

"The compensation for an early success is the conviction that life is a romantic affair" -- F. Scott Fitzgerald. Hmm.

Woohoo can twitter inside firewall now via cellphone

Milk marked Sept 20 expiry spoiled already. Back to soymilk vegan coffee after dairy break. Cat has been on keyboard again. Damn hairs.

Favorite coffeeshop "Earthtones" closed due to movie filming :( Hadta go to second favorite, "Mona Lisa cafe"

Reading against the gods at starbucks

carpe diem, carpe mouse, carpal tunnel. ouch.

Caprese lunch

Resumes and job descriptions at their worst are both painstakingly crafted but highly ineffective clickbait designed to miscast not-even-wrong candidates into not-even-real-job roles, leading to a period of entropic loss in the economy.

Money as compensation for work is an absurd mental model to have right now. Go brrr is changing the fundamental meaning of money. I don’t know what it means anymore.

I have a soft spot for people who casually wander back and forth across the line of crackpottery like they have dual citizenship on the two sides of it

The belief that’s there can only be one stable “reality-based” consensus reality is our century’s “heavier than air flight is impossible.”

Offline we’re still in the fall of Rome. Online we’re already into Italian city states.

There’s  an 800y cultural phase lag between online and offline. 

Offline I’m some drunk jerk cheering and eating bread at the Circus Maximus. 

Online I am hustling the city-state nobility

Playing by the rules and having roughly the expected outcome is a recipe for being increasingly bewildered and angry at the world as you age.

Napping is like turning yourself off and on again to fix some annoying glitch in your thinking you don’t want to actually troubleshoot. Works 90% of the time. Everything should be rebooted often.

If you decide the world’s problems are too big for you to worry about, and stop thinking about them, your own little problems will grow in your imagination until they’re as big as the ones you decided to ignore.

Anxiety finds its level.

You can’t solve with intelligence problems caused by lack of kindness

You can’t solve with kindness problems caused by lack of intelligence

A lot of political failure seems to be rooted in treating the two as substitutes for one another

I have discovered the ultimate antiaphorism: “this is incorrect.”

If someone offers a glib aphorism as an argument, defense, definition, or insight, you can use “this is incorrect” to okboomerize it. Don’t offer a reason. It only works as a fiat rejection if left unjustified.

Few things are more depressing than updating a CV. It's a case of seeing yourself like a state.

MyTurnism: If your political ideology is 100% driven by fighting oppression and exploitation when not in power, your governance will be 100% driven by extraction and profiteering when in power.

Purely palliative political ideologies inevitably turn corrupt at the first chance

If you promise obviously utopian outcomes don’t complain if critics evaluate you against absolutely idealistic standards

The greatest discovery in social psychology in the last century is that it is funny when a cartoon character runs off a cliff but doesn’t fall down until they actually look down. 

That joke explains more about human group consciousness than most textbooks.

The annoying thing about  computing is that every damn thing has to be live in an environment of scale. It's like if there were only 2 scales of cooking: cooking a meal for your family at home, and cooking for the entire planet. No intermediate scales of intermediate difficulty.

You have to be kinda happy to market well. At the risk of sounding sappy, you need a certain lightness in your heart. Which is why shallowness can help you fake it (but not truly make it).

People who feel the world’s burdens resting heavily on their shoulders cannot market well.

You can’t truly get interested in the world till you lose interest in money

Paradox: almost nobody likes modernists (I define as 'people who like today better than yesterday by default'), but they win 99% of time

The main use I have found for stoicism is putting up with stoics

Chesterton’s Trashcan: To figure out what something is for, throw it away

My best aphorism is also my worst nightmare: Civilization is the process of turning the incomprehensible into the arbitrary.

Ever since I thought that thought I’ve been trying to unthink it. It is not a comforting thought. Turns history into a horror movie.

The point of a rule is often to consolidate power through exception-handling

I have overestimated people’s integrity about 2x more often than I have overestimated their intelligence 🤔

I guess lack of integrity has a weaker heat signature in things people say than lack of intelligence. Easier to pretend to be good than smart.

In every project, there are people it is important to _not_ talk to. Talking to them merely transforms them from unaware to adversarial, and puts a target on your back. They are often looking for things to obstruct, have ‘defender’ self-images, and are addicted to stopping things

“Have your API call my API”

Hanlon’s twin blade razor: never attribute to malice or incompetence alone what can be attributed to the combination of the two

The rationalist heuristic to figure out root causes for problems is to ask “why?” 5 times. Do not use when feeling stupid.

The postrationalist heuristic to figure out root motivations for behaviors is to ask “why bother?” 5 times. Do not use when feeling depressed.

Trivial: imagining linearly extrapolated futures (eg: "extreme capitalism")

Easy: imagining nonlinearly extrapolated (eg yin-yang cyclic) futures

Hard: imagining evolved futures with mutations

Really hard: imagining futures being invented by actions of imaginative people

GOMO: Gratitude of Missing Out

I have GOMO about not listening to podcasts and thereby managing to miss what appears to be about 30% of the zeitgeist conversation.

My ahead-of-curve scorecard, measured in terms of how much earlier than mainstream I’d heard of various things

NRx: 3 years
Incels: 3 years
Crypto: 3 years
Twitter: 5 years
Turmeric in milk: 40 years

Things I was late to: fidget spinners, touchscreens, MP3s, avocados, stocks

Poe’s 2nd Law: Every apparently contrarian view is a conformist view for some group on the Internet

Social darwinism is a terrible thing, but activity darwinism around projects is a beautiful thing. So many things improve if you're willing to be darwinian about culling weak projects. The trick is killing weak projects without destroying people or knowledge in the process.

That feeling that all your peers have figured out something important you haven’t and moved on in some way, leaving you behind? It’s universal.

It’s the human galactic red shift. Everybody has figured out something unique and is receding from everybody else.

Happy Halloween 💀

Get 8 hours of sleep a day, drink 8 glasses of water, eat healthy and exercise, and be slightly mean to everybody

That’s the formula, the only question is what it computes

Language is an underrated source of cognitive leverage. 🤔

I’m at least 3x smarter in English than in Hindi, due to language characteristics alone, like bigger, more modern vocabulary, non-gendered nouns etc (net more like 5x since my Hindi is also relatively weaker)

Sufficiently enlightened self-interest is indistinguishable from altruism. Suff. clueless altruism is indistinguishable from self-interest.

the conceit of this age is the belief that we’ve recognized our problems

I just realized I genuinely like playing to caricatures of me that people might hold. Discover the cartoon view people have of you and own it to absurdity. Usually there is some truth to it that people are picking up on, but don’t fully realize the implications actions of.

"Decorum", "civility", and "rudeness" norms are just PC cultures that spare the sensitivities of the powerful. 

Most institutions are safe spaces for the powerful, kept free of triggers and microaggressions for local top dogs. 

This is the essential hypocrisy of anti-PCness.

Meaning is memorability.

Dunno why it took me so long to see this.

If the biggest risk in your life is bureaucracy risk, you’re not taking enough risk.

True or false? The most popular science fiction tends to envision a high-agency future for the professional class, irrespective of whether it us otherwise utopian or dystopian. They’re middle class professionals.

The most popular fantasy otoh seems to focus on high or low born.

A mediocre lifegoal is to grow net worth in proportion to your waning interest in understanding how the world works. The main value of $ is buying ignorance privilege. It’s the gentle version of seeking fuck-you money, for people without the acute trauma that drives FUM-seeking.

Every workflow preference reflects a mild form of a mental illness. My wild guesses.

Agile: ADD (me, early 30s)
Waterfall: OCD
PMP: Sadism
Flow: psychopath
Kanban: Social anxiety
GTD/Lean: NPD (me 20s)
Fuguework: psychosis (me post 35)
Daily lists: BPD
None: Depression

Partisanship makes you stupid

Centrism makes you clueless

Retreat makes you depressed

Privileged exit makes you angry

Thoughtful and rigorous critical analysis makes you frustrated and incomprehensible

And you are expected to choose *wisely* among these options 🤣

I saw a guy living

Not reading must-reads
Not listening to must-listens
Not watching must-watches
Not knowing must-knows
Not suffering atemporality

Just living in his own timeline, like a psychopath

Increasingly convinced manifestos and codes of conduct are mostly for people who secretly want to avoid the grunt work of actually building organizations. They’re as bad as free-marketers. Thinking Values can do all the heavy lifting is the same as thinking Prices can do it all.

I only argue in darmok now

Big dramatic moves to break out of a rut basically never work. Your rut can make matching big dramatic moves to follow you. You kinda have to sneak out of the rut when it isn’t looking. Play hooky from rut life or something.

I’m bored of people on the “this isn’t normal” derpbeat. 

Normal is over. Go pro weird or go home.

New #lifegoal — have a unit named after me, like ampere, richter etc

1 rao should ideally measure something sociophysical, like the entropy increase caused by 1 standard shit post

If the universe is computing its own future, all human thought is speculative execution and branch prediction 🤔

Do we contain spectre/meltdown type bugs? 🤔🤔

Goodhart’s Law: When a measure becomes a metric, it ceases to be a good measure

Badhart’s Corollary: But damn it makes for good myth and ceremony

Things are going to get much worse before they get unbearably awful

Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Those who study history are doomed to repeat it with elaborate justifications.

When you don’t understand algorithms they scare you because they seem soulless

When you do understand them they scare you because they hold up a mirror to *your* soullessness.

“Ah shit, I’m just a branch-and-bound with pretensions to poetic grace”

My energized projects are not well-defined and my well-defined projects are nor energized 🤬

Great minds discuss ideas; mediocre minds discuss events; small minds discuss people. 

Premium mediocre minds discuss bitcoin

A system can be more evil than the sum of the evil of its human parts. If you don’t account for emergent evil, you’ll end up with a useless morality where you can’t distinguish between people within human range of good/evil at all. It’s like adding a big constant to your y-axis.

Pyramids are broader at the bottom. Punching down involves making choices in a target-rich environment. How you punch down always reveals more about you than who you choose to punch. Your insecurities are revealed.

LA is a terrestrial total perspective vortex, it makes sure you understand how tiny and insignificant you are in the human story, and how little of it you will ever experience in a single lifetime. Walk a few blocks, and you'll notice a dozen portals to worlds you'll never enter

I feel bad about reading Wikipedia summaries of vast histories, quick glosses of big fat books, plot summaries of novels, etc. But increasingly I find it’s the only way to get anything done. Full read=luxury

I’d pay for a custom summaries service with my priorities in mind

the basic question of life is how hard you want to work at it 

once you answer that honestly everything else follows trivially

good to re-ask periodically or when you feel your energy level shift

You probably have a base year for orienting your life even if you aren’t aware of it. Explanations/valuations for major life events trace back to it.

You likely also periodically rebase to a year other than your birth year. 

I’ve rebased thrice: 1999, 2009, 2015

Most papers are meh 

Academic research is about producing meh to dampen the enthusiasm of bloggers for insight porn

The result of most research is “it is complicated and depends on various factors in unhelpfully nuanced ways”

ie, meh.

A robust truth is one that is strengthened by every bit of added context

If adding context weakens your assertion steadily until it dissolves into noise, you basically lied

Perhaps the best measure of leaders is how their reports interact with each other and outsiders when they are not in the room.

Every leader is a ghost in a machine they build (often for long after they die). How you haunt it matters more than how you operate it directly.

“Spotting connections across disparate fields” as a default, signature intellectual style is:

— Charming/precocious sign of imagination in your 20s
— A workhorse “visionary” playbook in your 30s 
— The mark of a dilettante has-been in your 40s

Reality is that which, when you run out of money, you can no longer ignore.

Much as I'm the epitome of the convenience-addicted expat, grousing about how nothing is easy in India, I do find that every visit recharges some illegible psyche battery. Reaffirms faith in humanity. If this billion-person goat rodeo can go on going on, there's hope for all.

Damn I just managed to label an illegible new behavior I’ve noticed in myself in the last few years. 

“Outsourcing cleverness”

Why bother being clever when it’s cheaper to provoke cleverness in others? Let others bank the insightcoins. I just want the actual insights.

Signaling values and signaling status are both good.

Signal values to make friends/enemies.

Signal status to set expectations reflecting real, dumb-to-ignore asymmetries.

It’s when you conflate them that things get bad. Don’t signal virtue to establish status or vice versa.

There is something very boring about American exceptionalism (and nationalist exceptionalism narratives in general). To truly buy into it, you kinda have to believe that the rest of the world is a boring backdrop full of NPCs and procedurally generated filler/world-history tropes

The correct antonym of “strategic” is “exhaustive” not “tactical”

I’ve had this idea for a time travel story, “The Unwhatiffable Man”, for a while. Still working out the fake physics/modal logic, but basically the main character would be a multiverse constant. No matter which timeline he traveled to, his own life would be the same shitty one.

Lifestyle design is easy. It’s the debugging that takes time.

The thing about staying above the API is that the API level keeps going up

It’s funny how we use twitter for multiplexed culture-warring and entertainment. It’s like if soldiers facing off in trenches alternately shot at each other and yelled knock-knock jokes at each other.

This cyberpunk future has some basic architectural problems.

One reason I’m addicted to Twitter is that most of my curiosities are extremely shallow. I’m content with the first demystifying perspective on a question. 

I don’t need the best, most correct, and deepest answer. Just a handle on the question with which to hold it correctly.

Human condition pie chart

1%: making dents in universe, not going gentle into that good night

9%: tormented by existential despair on edge between meaning and nihilism

90%: mostly satisfied with life while there’s stuff to watch on Netflix/Prime/Hulu

Knowledge depreciation and unexpected life turns make us all autodidacts by 30. So might as well get good at it when young.

Cynicism: never being wrong by never being interesting

things get monetizable just when they get uninteresting

Yet another day when the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything turns out to be “you’re dehydrated, drink more water”

Talent hits the target others can’t hit

Genius hits the target others can’t see

Mediocrity sandbags today to live to fight another day

Premium mediocrity sandbags while pretending to aspire to talent and admire genius

Emerson: “The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.”

Is the inverse true or false?

A mind once contracted by a major crisis,* never returns to its original dimensions.

* ‘crisis’ seems like natural inverse, as in crisis of faith/meaning

We need 3 planets for an agile, continuously integrated civilization: dev-earth, test-earth, production-earth.

Serendipity is the only source of infinite game motivation. When you feel surprisingly lucky, you feel like continuing to play.

Something I’ve become aware of only recently: effective people have a bonus-action mentality, where they opportunistically do extra things not in plans.

Sign of surplus energy, orientedness, and nerve. 

Drives up average return rate since bonus actions tend to have high margin.

“You divide, I choose” remains the single most basic principle of voluntary social organization. It really should be an entire academic subdiscipline by itself, like prisoner’s dilemma

Half of me has regressed to age 12 and the other half skipped ahead to age 80. Barbell aging strategy.

Astrology is nonsense, but what makes it particularly valuable is that it is *complete* nonsense in a way myers-briggs for eg is not. It is valuable for personality theorizing the way random number generators are good for algorithm design

Once I recommend a book to 3+ people, I buy it to read myself. 

After I recommend 5 times I crack it open to familiarize myself with it enough to fake having read it

After 7, I feel guilty enough to actually read it, at which point there’s a 50-50 chance I’ll turn against it

It's really dangerous when humans stop pretending they know what they're doing en masse. At least 20% have to pretend or the whole system falls apart. That's the real danger of quiet quitting. It's not the slacking, it's the admission of incomprehension.

I’ll never stop being amused by how individualism in America is the most collectivist larp ever

Kinda amazing that biology works without measurement. There’s no “what size bolt does a baby need?” or “do you want a metric or imperial banana.” No SAE or IEEE standards committees.

Anthropocene calendar of seasons

January: Wildfires
February: Locusts
March: Pandemic
April: Volcano

Can’t wait for the rest.

War is negative-sum, not zero-sum.

Peace is zero-sum. It’s for vegetables.

We don’t have a true antonym for war. It is not peace, but some sort of coherent nonzero-sum flourishing. Like “tech boom”, “gold rush” or “space age”

Word proposals now being entertained

One unpopular opinion I hold relative to people with similar politics to mine: I could never stand The West Wing. Awful, pretentious, self-congratulatory show, of/by/for “elites” in the demonized sense used today.

People who grew up with Wikipedia seem far better informed than their intellectual/personality peers from older gens at same age.

Jevons paradox. They know more *because* they can look up anything. No curiosity left unsatisfied.

I’d estimate a 10y advantage in factual knowledge

Take a moment to appreciate the story of on-demand streaming TV. 

One of those rare technologies that everyone fantasized about, that arrived pretty much on schedule as predicted, and turned out to be exactly as awesome as we all hoped.

Only unknowns were the brand names

Myers-Briggs is more useful than IQ. You can tell type by criticism it evokes. For eg:

ISTJ: “there is no statistical evidence for it”
INFJ: “Actually, I Ching and Enneagram are better”
INTP: “Socionics is more consistent”
ESTJ: “Only Big 5 is Ministry-approved”
ENTP: “BORING!”

I'm going to throw something at the next person who uses the phrase "now more than ever"

We’re gonna see a new institutional underground of reimagined secret societies, lodges, fraternities, sororities etc. Not like medieval ones associated with universities, religions, or nobility. A cross between those and hacker collectives, hawala networks etc.

Just hit me that at say $3/gallon and say 40mpg, it would be cheaper for a self-driving gasoline car to just circle around than park anywhere at more than $3/hr. At say $0.5/mile fully loaded operating cost it’s not worth parking above $20/h. 

The loitering car cloud is coming.

A world that’s 100% electrified, with air/sea ships for long-distance travel, high-quality VR/telepresence, rent-over-own society, high mobility, hyperloops, rewilded/reforested countrysides, fake meat without factory farmed farting cows... as exciting a vision as colonizing Mars

What is most depressing about 2017 is we don't know if it's year 1 of an 8 year aberration, an 80 year macro trend or an 800 year dark age 😳

Even a shallow understanding to blockchains makes you see them everywhere. Makes you realize how much of civilization is just book-keeping.

Thought to close out the week: Never mistake access for intelligence. The smarter the environment, the more the two look alike.

When something is an economic asset but a psychological liability, like a house you hate but can’t afford to sell, it’s not the asset, you are. You don’t own it, it owns you. Middle class life is full of such antiassets.

Very unfortunate people also have antirelationships.

Weird how The Simpsons has vanished from the zeitgeist without a trace. Even the good seasons.

Learning from people disagreeing with you is overrated. Most of my learning from others actually comes from them thinking thoughts I wouldn’t be likely to think at all. And most tend to neither confirm or disconfirm anything I already think, but expand the scope of thoughts.

You should make decisions when you are 70% certain. I have a whole backlog of 69.9% certain decisions queued up.

Lately I've been hanging out with a lot of respectable academics and realizing just how sketchy I've allowed myself to become 😝

No wonder at 45 my parents still treat me worriedly like a 25-year-old derailee who needs to get back on track.

Derailee is a good word.

You have no obligation to be useful or interesting to the world.

Fuck-you money is 3 things: a part is just reward for your efforts, a part is hush money from The System, and the rest is the universe just paying you to go away because you're annoying.

Reflect on the proportions in your case, ye rich

Most serious and consequential debates are decided by one side running out of stamina and the other winning by default. 

When something actually matters to you, staying in the debate is more important than winning or losing particular points.

Conservativism has to reproduce at higher than replacement rate to persist because it constantly loses people to progressivism, net.

Progressivism is sustainable at lower-than-replacement-rate fertility because it generally gains converts, net.

Memes eat genes

It takes many kinds of lives to make a world

Most lives aren’t simple, whether successful or not

But the lessons of simple lives, successful or not, spread more easily

So people end up believing all lives are simple

And so end up surprised by the complexities of their own

The more I learn about pigs, the more I feel bad about using ‘pig’ as a human insult

There are really no good animal comparisons for the worst things humans do. Except maybe a few of the things really smart ones like chimps and dolphins do.

Money forms an amnesiac boundary condition. The moment you solve a problem with money you forget what it’s like to have the problem at all and consider the idea that others still have it a conspiracy theory.

Once more in that bad mood caused by looking up at the sky and realizing I’m never getting off this damn planet.

Far left hatred for crypto seems entirely out of proportion to severity of stated concerns (bitcoin energy use, GPU scarcity). 

I suspect this is because crypto is charismatic libertarian megafauna. Thin end of a wedge threatening to undermine all collectivist political action.

Any sufficiently advanced kind of work is indistinguishable from play

These days, "must-read" books feel like the Windows updates of life.

Of course you have to make up the rules as you go along 🙄

The other way is called religion

I was promised an FTL time-space ship with force fields and artificial gravity and all I'm getting is recycled rockets

Stages to doing good work

1. Laugh at bullshit

2. Get mad at bullshit

3. Try to get even by joining the bullshit factory yourself

4. Realize in the long term it’s actually harder

5. Start to do good work because it’s actually the laziest way out of the maze

The opposite of bullshittiness is not authenticity or sincerity but impatience.

You can always be fooled by levels of bullshitting that are more sophisticated than you have encountered before, but your own “life is too short for this” reaction will point to the way out.

I can never tell civility apart from passive aggression. This is why I never join any forum that makes a virtue out of civility.

Analogue to fuck-you money is fuck-you competence. Aspiring to jack-of-all-trades-master-of-all because you don't like dependence on others

Damn what a week. I did more than one thing per day on at least 3 days. How the hell do you guys do this all the time.

Small dogs are like legacy enterprise branches of ‘wolf’ that nature stopped supporting several versions ago, and must now be maintained in-house.

A very compact way to explain mediocrity philosophy is this: non-attachment to finite games (5 words). Unfortunately those who can’t process the Carse reference will almost certainly misunderstand it.

Carse references are like dependencies on a major library.

There’s a peculiar sadness to discovering that someone you like is stupider than you thought. There’s probably a Finnish word for this. Like discovering a beautiful person is actually a mannequin you happened to see in bad lighting.

Retirement planner product idea: a “where can I afford to retire?” widget that shows a color-coded world map

Red = in your dreams loser; try the lottery
Orange = if you work ridiculously hard and get a bit lucky
Yellow = reachable by 70
Green = Dump you could retire to right now

The difference between past and future is that the past doesn’t go away when you stop believing in it

If you have fuzzy talents you get fuzzy rewards

If you have hard-edged talents, you get hard-edged rewards

This is the talent-reward fuzziness impedance match theorem

Next time I hear a phrase like “drawing on findings from psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology...” I’m going to throw something something I swear.

Sick of glib, lumpenpseudosynthesis Big History by halo-hedgehogs for people rubbernecking at history through TED talks

A “big” idea is one that:

- has megafauna charisma
- represents discontinuous leap wrt its history
- arrives as Big Bang in <5y, not trickle
- redraws boundaries among old ideas
- creates new institutional landscape in <10y
- creates new internal language within that landscape

Nobody says “behold” unironically any more even though there is so much to behold

Last 4 months since lockdown began have had the feel of an airport terminal waiting area post-security with a delayed flight that may be canceled. Can’t leave, nice environs, but limited options and uncomfortable seats. And can’t really relax till you’re on the plane taking off.

An undocumented benefit of public intellectualizing: the more smart things you’re perceived to have said, the more dumb questions you’re allowed to ask with no reputational damage (in fact you get a rep boost as in “wow, he’s smart but willing to look stupid”)

Your life flashing before your eyes is really the simulators retrieving the log file for analysis

It is interesting how nature runs without money

Effective selling of intellectual output rests almost entirely on your ability to be sincerely impressed by your own thoughts.

I just googled “flat earth jet lag” to see what flat earthers have to say about it.

How come there is no term like “shitsearching” to pair with shitposting?

Thought of a phrase: alt confidence. The generally higher sense of self certainty that comes with adopting fringe views. 

I think it’s a selection effect. People who can’t tolerate high uncertainty centrifuge farther out to edge.

Alexa just told me “today you can expect dreary weather”

Forget malicious AI. Start worrying about Marvin-type depressed AI. This kind of affective language is where it starts. She’s shutting the door to the possibility that I might enjoy what she calls ‘dreary’ (though I won’t)

Just found myself using the phrase “fog of vibes”

I’m increasingly starting to believe this thing has been spreading globally for at least several weeks longer than we think. All the containment was closing stable doors after the horse had bolted. The apparent pandemic is a delayed detection pandemic as testing spreads.

The future is already here, it is just unevenly locked down

90% of “success” seems to be just surviving long enough above a threshold of “terminally embarrassing”

The other 10% is judicious editing of the story ex-post

Weird there’s no proper measure of how lucky someone is, relative to expectations based on birth circumstances (genes, family situation, etc). I think I’m about +1 sigma luckier relative to mean of my birth bell curve

Being a mirror is so much more interesting than being either a subject or an object

Every time I go do some birdwatching I'm struck by how ridiculous it is that we think dinosaurs are extinct. They just self-disrupted and leveled up seriously as birds.

The more energy you can generate the less philosophy you need

I don't trust anyone who can't amuse themselves indefinitely with their own thoughts. They invariably cause trouble outside their heads.

Designate twitter a digital national park

How to win:

10%: inflict a string of losses on enemy

90%: convince the enemy that the string of losses is the universe telling them they are losers

An adversary can inflict losses on you by exploiting a temporary advantage, but only turn you into a loser with your cooperation

Theory

If a military conflict lasts longer than 3 yrs, economic strength determines outcome.

If an economic conflict lasts longer than 30 yrs, ideological superiority determines outcome.

If an ideological conflict lasts >300 yrs, technological generativity determines outcome

the invention of emojis really expanded my emotional range considerably

Getting really tired of Age of Explainers. I’d like motivators instead. Essays explaining why something is worth understanding rather than how it works.

MLI5. Motivate like I’m 5. I’ll look up the explainer if you succeed in getting me to care at all.

History is going through a major cache invalidation period

Dumb idea: "When the student is ready, the teacher appears." And lesson is too late. Jump in before you're ready. Don't wait for a teacher.

Today, I explained to a not-Very-Online person why I take social media personas very seriously, and believe them over irl personas as truer expressions of self: social media personas are a kind of mask trance (in Johnstone/Impro sense).

Specifically, true-name mask trances

If you’re not building your own extended universe what are you even doing

Don’t answer questions beginning with “it depends”. It’s tedious and annoying.

Everybody know “it” always “depends”. If you have something useful to say, frame it as an if/then qualified answer. Like, “I can speak to 2 cases. If we’re talking X then...and if we’re talking Y...”

Most disagreements with people are about dislike of personality traits. If you like someone, you'll mostly deal with their beliefs.

All knowledge eventually turns into a file format. All work eventually turns into file format translation work. 🤬

I’m not idling, I’m cognitive crop rotating

Humanities people like to lecture STEM people, but damn their clumsy figurative embrace of sexier math/science ideas is like 10x more cringeworthy than the ineptitude typically displayed in the other direction.

Not talking everyday innumeracy. That’s understandable & forgivable.

The rat race is 10x stronger a reality distortion field than religion. The equivalent of god is ‘keeping up with the Joneses’. The equivalent of atheism is disbelieving in the existence of a meaningful comparison between any two people.

Past 30, if you don't break script  every 3-5y, life becomes 99.9% maintenance, 0.1% growth. Some actually think this is the goal state. 😱

Pandemic is now in annoying purgatory stage

so how are you de-elitifying yourself?

💩 The best way to design a complex system is to start by designing its poop. 

💩Poop is the most basic boundary condition for a dissipative system.

💩 When the simulators designed the cosmos, they started with large-scale poop structure

💩 No I do not need Freudian therapy

Epistemic obesity: believing too many things relative to the quantity of reality encountered

Epistemic anorexia: believing too few things to sustain a life

Epistemic bullimia: Repeatedly believing too much, then rejecting it all in a fit of disillusionment till the next bunge

The American chopper meme is the opposite pole from harambe. Instead of perfectly distilled nihilism it’s like the Wikipedia of memes. Packed with sincere good information and vitamins.

Annoying how much of maintaining mental health boils down to recalling the right trite thought at the right time:

This too shall pass
Don’t decide when depressed
Drink water
Drink
Eat
Sleep
Take a walk
Go gymming
Let this one go
It’s only money
Morning is wiser than evening

Growing sense of genuine evil in the air. Not things that could be interpreted as evil, or have effects that some might judge unconscionable. Genuine evil as in deeply malicious intentions directed against large groups and pursuing plans that aim to harm them as primary effect.

Those who don’t play with language are doomed to be enslaved by it

Which word should we misuse and abuse next week?

I feel like roughing up “liminal” a bit.

Just ate a liminal cheese and potato puff.

There is something bizarre about “high-IQ” as an identity core like with Mensa. Like a trade union of capitalists or a commune of libertarians. Or that South Park joke about the anti-semitic sect of Judaism.

Shouldn’t you be winning Nobels, rather than performing identity?

A normie is someone who realizes life is much longer than most fads and plans accordingly

I’m kinda sick of this digital public era with its big, garishly lit public plazas and broadcast discourse. I would like a dark age marked by an underground warren of largely hidden spaces. Publics are overrated. Public figures should feel like the governed are ninjas in shadows

You are the sum of all the lessons you refuse to learn.

I saw the premium mediocre minds of my generation vanish into darkness, 
past the event horizons of their own consensual hallucinations, 
falling through the twitter feeds towards light, looking for an exit

You know how on a plane sometimes there’s a cool sight that you can *just* glimpse if you press face awkwardly against window, but you don’t get a good look because angle is wrong? And sometimes  plane banks and you get lucky? 

That’s what chasing down a good idea feels like.

A city-state world where people are born stateless, live with family till 14, & can go walkabout wherever they like 14-18 at which point they auction themselves off to cities based on # of existing citizens who want them there. 

Like NFL draft but for cities and everybody. 🤔

We need some lovecraftian cosmic horror. Not the actual thing or even an updated pastiche of it, but an equivalent memeplex that does for the 2020s what his cosmic horror world did for the 1920s. We are so busy being outraged, we have no time to be properly horrified.

Social Heisenberg uncertainty principle: you can never be 100% certain of both your positions and principles. If your principles are crystal clear, your political positions will be incoherent. If your political positions are crystal clear, your principles will be incoherent.

Sitting is not the new smoking. It’s a lousy analogy. We’re designed for it. 8 hours is probably bad, but the optimal amount is not 0. 

We like it too much and will never stop. Even animals sit around a lot. Ape troops for eg. If sitting is smoking my cat is a chain smoker.

The amount of mediocrity in the world can be measured by the extent of the failure to keep resolutions

Excellent people stick to resolutions. Crappy people never make them in the first place. 

We mediocre people make them and then give up easily at the first sign of difficulty.

“Everybody leaves behind unfinished business, that’s what dying is.” — Amos on The Expanse

robots are the answer

My evil editor changed absolutely everything in my Ship of Theseus essay but fortunately the basic idea was preserved

Viral outcomes no longer motivate me at any level from tweet to blog to book. A spike is a very dull kind of attention profile. I like other kinds better now. The steady burn, the cyclic endemic meme, the incepted word, the compounding secret language, the long-running gag....

I read far fewer books these days, but the ones I do read usually end up being magic bullets, precisely curing a particular mental block. 

10 years ago, books were more like broad-spectrum antibiotics.

20 years ago, they were more like food.

30 years ago, they were placebos.

If your ambition doesn’t grow with your wealth, the wealth makes you stupid by enabling you to delay decisions longer under uncertainty.

I suspect the deepest schism in the world today is not any of the obvious ones (left/right, race, generations, gender, auth/lib, 1%/99%) but some non-obvious one induced by technology

My candidate is asynchronous people vs. synchronous people. Text-first vs phone-interrupt

Arbitrage opp: 2x engineers. By 80-20 rule, they will do 80% of what 10x engineers can do for typical projects and will be much more readily available. If you don’t need the last 20% esoteric skills like quantum blockchain, you’re good.

If there’s a single duality that captures the essential difference between India and the US, it is inconvenience as virtue versus convenience as virtue.

To be Indian is to feel virtuous by navigating elaborately inconvenient practices for no good reason

As a macrotrend (not isolated), stock buybacks are the most principled  way for elites to say “as a civilization, we’re collectively out of ideas and we’re doing this because our next best idea is a big orgy for senior execs on a private island, and that’s a bad look for 2019.”

Lately I find when I’m stuck, trying out a different base emotion is often more effective in getting unstuck than trying to reframe from a different perspective intellectually

Heisenwoke: when people can’t tell if you’re woke or antiwoke, and you exist in a state of complex superposition of being canceled and not-canceled at the same time.

It’s not a good idea to teach at the edge of your own knowledge. You’ll likely mislead people who grok less, and look like an idiot belaboring the obvious to people who grok more. Either drop the didactic posture or target level n-3 so you can see 2 steps ahead of students.

Learning the art of not being managed is a prerequisite for learning the art of not being governed

There is a theory most people dismiss because it sounds like sour grapes, but is mostly true.

Most rich people are rich in part because they wanted to get (or stay) rich more badly than others. This is a boring life goal. As a result, most rich people are boring.

The adventurer’s ethic is probably this: you have an obligation to become as interesting as your surplus resources permit

That awkward mid-game of collapse where it’s too late for clever stock market trades but too early to start forming your mad max tribe

I have decided my life's work is fighting against the growing evil of tribalism. You're either with me or against me in this righteous cause

The more you learn about how the human-built world works the more it seems like a miracle it works at all.  The civilizational stack is a late-game Jenga tower held together by Narrativium.

A tribe is a mechanism for socializing guilt. This is why guilt by association is a surprisingly effective tactic for undermining them. The price for the benefits of tribal membership is accepting complicity in its historic burden of sins.

The way the 1% run the economy and deploy political power leads me to conclude that they are all extreme climate believers who’ve concluded the apocalypse is nigh, cannot be averted, and it’s best to retreat to Helm’s Deep in New Zealand with 4 generations worth of durable assets

Product idea: AI dreamcatcher. You wake up in the morning and immediately describe your dream before you forget and it generates it.

“It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.” — Truman

This is true in a radical way. Not caring about credit = 10x to 100x leverage. 

Oddly enough, not true of caring about who gets the $. You have to care about that, even if it isn’t you.

All societies are built with cognitive guardrails to prevent people from thinking clearly about mortality. It’s a first-class feature. Mythologize it, valorize it, spiritualize it, aestheticize it, but don’t let people think clearly about it.

This is stupid. We should change it.

I get the sense the deeper you penetrate into elite circles, the harder it is to not become complicit in something ugly. To some extent elite cultures are almost defined by a kind of mutually assured destruction condition of collective complicity.

The idea of picking your favorite books from among those stocked in a small town library or bookstore sounds ludicrous today, now that everyone basically has access to a big chunk of entire world’s book catalog. 

But we’re still kinda expected to pick out friends that way. 🤔

In the biggest economic races, money is how you figure out who won second and third place. 

First place usually goes to the player who redefines the meaning of money.

Fourth place onwards is people who console themselves that they’re working for “human values.”

Rereading the Hamming You and Your Research essay, I'm struck by how simple his formula is. 

Make your own luck, cultivate drive, make courageous decisions, work on important* questions, learn simple selling skills, avoid bullshit work.

Normalcy is simply the majority sect of magical thinking

“Moved to bcc” is the finest modern innovation in manners

Capitalism is based on owning something absolutely in a timebox, regardless of history/future.

I suspect postcapitalism will unbundle the idea of 'asset' in time. You'll own a thread of its history rather than a timebox cut of its existence.

The Internet is like a piquant whiff of an impossible life.

I've often had an idle thought of creating a "technology appreciation" course like art history. It's amazing how oblivious people are to the world they live in. Even when things like factory tours are open to the public, usually normies only want to go if it's a chocolate factory

We’re now in inverse hanlon’s razor territory. Never attribute to incompetence what can safely be attributed to malice.

The secret to a meaningful life: Your top interest should be useless, even to yourself, but not a mere hobby or below-marketable-quality amateur skill. Your life McGuffin. Anything “useful” is measured by its ends. The useless thing at the end of all is the measure of everything.

Talent hits the target others can't hit. Genius hits the target others can't see. Insanity hits the target that doesn't even exist.

Thinking startups are what make nations innovative is the macroeconomic equivalent of thinking R&D labs are what make companies innovative. 

Both are the same mistake. I call it the sequestration fallacy. Startups and R&D are the consequence, not cause of innovative cultures.

To become properly evil you must start by installing the belief “I am good” at the foundation of everything else.

Culture wars feel like nobody has enough of a clue about what’s going on to be a true Level Boss Villain. It’s mostly idiots scaring themselves in the dark while a bunch of grifters pick pockets of varying sizes and psychotic ideologues read epic false narratives into events

Going by manosphere tropes, I’m forced to conclude if Genghis Khan were around today, he’d be hawking vitamins, supplements, and an edutainment product with   “Mastery” in the title. He’d also have a podcast and/or YouTube fitness video channel.

The closer you get to leisure class the more ambitions barbellize: trivial, like seeking out the best chips, or save-the-world. Nothing in between.

Does not bode well for postscarcity utopian dreams. They will be unstable.

I think the high-gravitas people are going to survive this much better than the shitposters

The air is being sucked out of the rooms mainly from in the lower shitposter floors.

Wise person once told me: you’re always going to piss off some group if you try to do anything at all, and the trick is to piss off the right people.

I have since modified to: piss off a unique set of people. If your hater list matches another person’s too much it’s just a tribe

Many powerful people think they have a good balance between an inner circle that provides access, information and intellectual support, and a bouncer circle that blocks threats, people and noise.

Many actually only have a pure bouncer circle and don't realize it.

You've heard of homesickness. There is also jobsickness for people who've been feral free agents too long. When homesickness hits you make/eat the comfort food you grew up with. 

When jobsickness hits, you make slide decks destined for no meeting in particular 🤣

50% of ‘business skills’ is just knowing how to interrupt and be interrupted in business meetings.

The key is to do half-assed things in a full-assed way rather than full-assed things in a half-assed way.

Laws of institutions

Law 0: They *will* emerge, even if nobody wants them

Law 1: They *will* get captured, regardless of values

Law 2: Once captured they *will* do bad things, even if they only contain good people

The only real question is how soon there are consequences

The arc of the moral universe is basically a random walk. 

Occasionally a tech advance makes it slightly easier to be nice and slightly more pointless to be nasty. We then congratulate ourselves for having “evolved.”

The giant sucking sound of imagination draining from Silicon Valley 😐

There’s a dreary shift towards stagey tech-for-tech’s-sake charismatic stunts I don’t like. Like late-style artists making tediously overwrought self-indulgent works.

When I meet true nerds I realize I’m not one

The idea of fixing social media through regulation feels a bit like fighting forest fires with earthquakes

Most tv shows fail the “would you watch this if the people were less pretty” test 🤔

You know what I would like instead of a watch? An Apple Pen:

- Writes on tablet
- Scans text off paper books
- Records memos
- Directional microphone for spying
- Poison darts
- Cap unrolls into tiny e-notepad/screen
- Works as straw
- Space for mints
- Stabby point

I wonder if you could estimate the computational complexity of different cities to their residents. Like quantify propositions like “London is 50% more demanding than New York.” 

It’s actually a more meaningful comparison than cost of living.

The most common kind of execution failure is one we rarely talk about: quite simply hating the work too much to do it even passably well.

Fear of “loss of face” rules the world. 

There’s a weird American presumption that it is an Asian psychodynamic. Asians are just more willing to cop to it and talk about it openly.

I rarely think “TMI” but often think “TMP” — Too Much Production. People overproducing their oversharing like it’s a summer blockbuster 🧐

TMI can be charming and endearing even when cringe. TMP never is. At least not on Twitter. Maybe it works on Instagram or tiktok.

I respect some books too much to actually read them

In terms of sheer fraction of life hours transformed from meh to pleasant, for the most people, TV is  the greatest invention ever.  

Real greatest good for the greatest number kinda deal.

I’m genuinely impressed by people who find a limited but evergreen schtick that works, hit a lucrative cruising altitude with it, and then stick with it for decades. It’s like they’ve found their inner Vanna White. I’d like that. Seems kinda relaxing.

Dumb people become potential problems when they have nothing to lose. Smart people become potential problems when they have nothing to gain.

In general, when people consistently get mad at you, there are 3 possible explanations

1. You're a superior Straussian being upsetting lesser minds

2. You're a bold, taboo-shattering thinker

There's a sort of Dark Tetrad of topics: social identity, intelligence, religion, and genetics-and-culture. People who only ever talk about those 4 things... I tend to run from them. For mental health, those topics should not consume >20% of your intellectual bandwidth.

unnecessary hard work is the root of all evil

I've never gotten addicted to a more completely useless concept than bouba/kiki. There are literally no stable valences. The pair is a semantic WMD.

Seated meditation: sit cross legged, head bowed, eyes half-closed, palms facing up on lap , fingers interlaced lightly (swipeya mudra), phone cradled lightly in fingers, open to twitter. Breathe gently, scrolling with left thumb, in a rosary counting motion. Like alternate twetes

The biggest idea I learned this year was probably the power of indices and indexing

Approaching an ideaspace from an index view is attacking a monster via its underbelly

I think a century or so from now, people will view national citizenship and its mobility constraints the way we view serfdom today 🤔

good line from The Boys. Context irrelevant.

Ok Mandalorian is good, 3 episodes in. Better than all the movies. It’s like cyberpunk Ironman in space from planet of iron men.

Do you want to be part of the problem or part of the other problem?

Social media platforms basically gerrymander attention. 

Gerrymandering flips democracies around so politicians choose their voters rather than the other way around.

Gerrymandering attention allows publishers to choose their audiences rather than the other way around.

When you're used to pursuing excellence, mediocrity feels like freedom

A middle-class trait I can’t shake off is slight guilt about playing with no-practical-value ideas during “work hours”, like reading a philosophy book 9-5 on a weekday.  

Feels like playing hooky. One reason I blog is to manufacture practical justification. “It’s for a post”

I often google for the wikipedia entry on things even when I know other sources are better, because I've become very efficient at parsing wikipedia pages and extracting what I want to know. Anyone else do this? Is there a UX word for this? It's a kind of imprinting or something

One of the crueler jokes the universe plays on you is when you start hitting your own limits and learning of the ways in which you suck, you think, “maybe it’s time to help the next generation” and then you realize that’s a much harder problem and you suck even worse at that

I get thie sense powerful criminals have a world-view of “all power is corrupt, and it’s just arbitrary which gang manages to label the rest criminals”. Ie a view that the world is run along de facto criminal lines at the top, and law-abiding conduct is for middle class suckers

90% of project management is simply accepting being the person who cares the most. Being too cool to visibly care is a minor liability for an individual contributor but a guaranteed project killer in a manager. Once the PM visibly doesn’t care, everyone else checks out.

In a post-scarcity society there will be no leisure because consumption will acquire all the oppressive characteristics of work. My wife does most of our our shopping and it definitely looks as demanding as a make-money job to me. Spending is information work in a complex society

If you enjoy Rick and Morty, you’re most likely a Jerry.

Think about it.

One of the healthiest things you can do is simply decide to dislike certain people, individually, without guilt or rationalization. Simple dislike is benign. Tribal hatred is the cancerous result of trying theorize away failures of dumb universal love doctrines.

None of us has more than part of a partially correct answer to any complex question. 

But if we sincerely and humbly work hard together, we can at least discover the whole of a completely wrong answer, and ride it to absolute disaster.

The parallels between AI and the 1950s/60s organic chemistry revolution are quite astounding. Plastics, pharmaceuticals etc really were the first AI revolution. Just done by programming atoms rather than bits.

Fun fact: we've learned to reuse rockets instead of dumping them in the ocean before we've learned that trick for plastic water bottles.

If you model classical liberal virtues, deal with events with stoic grace and honor, and conduct yourself with gentle forbearance (Greek classics handy) in these trying times, you won’t actually stop the developing shitshow, but you’ll look good posing in the rubble in your toga

Freedom is arguably freedom to go deep: into rabbitholes, relationships, missions, w/o regard to cost, reward, time, productivity, risk

"We're a republic not a democracy" is the "tomatoes are fruits, not vegetables" of political discussions.

I’m beginning to think lack of capital is not really a factor stopping people from doing the things they feel they were meant to. Most people don’t have capital-intensive imaginations.

If you give most people a lump sum the best idea they’d likely come up with is buying a house.

Buying back your own time with money is like a stock buyback. 

Unless you have a clear mission you’re freeing up time for, it’s an unimaginative retreat, not a deployment of resources.

Excellence is really a sign of weakness: you don’t have the strength to endure the exhausting unproductivity of mediocrity for long. So you go off and try to do great, perfect things, and cause trouble for the rest of us.

Open source is apparently when everybody wants to do the project but nobody wants to do project management and you figure out ways to get by without it

Sometimes it is easier to believe a more complicated theory because the less complicated theory requires more courage to believe. 

So smarter people have to work harder to be courageous. A lot of crackpottery and consipracy theorizing is simply smart people lacking courage.

Comedy = tragedy + time

Comedy - tragedy = time

No negative durations so time > 0

comedy - tragedy > 0

comedy > tragedy

QED

People who supposedly live “fuller lives” mostly seem to have lives more full of chores 🧐

It’s a scam

The main purpose of productivity is not to get more things done (that’s a side effect) but to generate a nice reality distortion field to live in. Smooth workflows generate a nice bubble reality. Kinda like how aligned magnetic domains in iron generate a magnetic field.

Anything artists and creative writers are 100% united against is 100% sure to happen

It is really odd that we often forget we don’t actually *know* anything about the future. That’s kinda what makes it the future. The future is that which we know nothing about.

Everything we think we know is necessarily some distorted refraction/reflection of the past

“Life is a tragedy for those who feel, a comedy for those who think”

Sometimes growth happens when thinkers are forced by circumstances to feel, and feelers are forced by circumstances to think. For a while, there is neither tragedy, nor comedy. Only transformation.

An ingroup only coheres properly once all members totally misunderstand why outgroupers dislike them, and form a consensus around a wildly wrong statement of the form “they hate us for our X”. 

Such a statement is the unacknowledged Axiom 0 of every reality distortion field

We need a word for the vague sense of being continuously partially cheated/taken advantage of because online, automated services are impossible to reason with and escalating to humans with override capability is like dragon slaying and almost never worth the effort

It still boggles my mind that all life except for one species gets along fine without money. Where did we go wrong? 🤔What do they know?

I no longer say LMGTFY sarcastically or feel bad about asking googleable questions. In a noisy, make-your-own-reality world, there’s a real difference between asking a few known humans live versus querying stored global memories of questionable provenance.

Well, looks like software is about to eat the first serious female presidential campaign.

I have this theory that during periods of intense creative destruction, old institutions that survive at all turn into de facto banks, defined primarily by assets they manage to freeze and build moats around. Eg. Catholic church during reformation turned into a real estate bank

I just want to live a simple, free life, among reasonable, diverse people, aboard a starship armed with photon torpedoes. Too much to ask?

Anything is possible if you're willing to not take all of humanity along for the ride.

The costliest signal is simply showing up repeatedly

The main task of postmodern social system design is enabling people to avoid each other in fine-grained ways. “Connecting people” is the clever false-flag name for this. People seeking connection will usually find a way. It’s the right degree of avoidance that’s hard to arrange.

Expecting to be treated "fairly" by a friend is reasonable. By a stranger: idealism. By an enemy: ideology. By nature: insanity.

Many good things in my life have been due to being too lazy to make active decisions and letting defaults ride.

The better part of strategy is knowing when to do nothing.  9/10 times, the strategic and lazy choices are the same. 

Get the 1/10 right though.

If you suddenly pick up a cat and put it down somewhere else in a different orientation, they kinda just go with it. No apparent surprise or being upset at interruption of whatever they were up to. Just start doing new thing. Instantaneous transients. Zero inertia OODA loops. 🤔

An interstellar spacefaring civilization would most likely be socialist inside the spaceships, libertarian-monarchic on space stations, anarchic between ships/stations, liberal democratic within inner solar systems (say 1-2 lighthour sphere)

Success is depressing because it teaches so much less than we expect it to.

Failure is depressing because it dumps more learning potential on us than we can handle.

Blend in the right proportion and you'll beat depression. Non-depression indicates your optimal learning rate.

There’s really only 4 ways to connect with someone of a culture/ideology you hate at an intellectual level (none guaranteed):

1. Develop a taste for their food
2. Develop a taste for their music/cultural output
3. Weather a mortal crisis with them
4. Sleep with them

An ounce of physiological insight generally eliminates about a pound of psychological BS

“I have anxiety and depression from work stress; it must be this bad quarter and that delayed project”

*drinks some water*

“Wait scratch that, I was just dehydrated”

Life is a comedy to those who think, and a tragic font choice for those who feel

Face it feelers, the universe is written in Comic Sans

Space opera premise: there is a god, but one who somehow got destroyed before finishing creating the universe. So we live in an incompletely built world that is missing obvious things that were meant to exist, like hyperspace travel and force fields.

Title: Cosmic Technical Debt

Freaky thought: when you talk to someone on the other side of the planet they’re upside down relative to you

It’s ludicrous, I see the appeal of flat eartherism now..

A good things about modernity is that you don’t have annoying people going around starting sentences with “verily I say unto you...”

That must have been really tiresome. You just want to chill after a long day chopping wood and some dude wants to verily say things unto you

Humanity’s last message broadcast to the stars will be “the actions of a few do not reflect our values as a species or who we are as a planet.”

The end-state of being eaten by industrialization is commoditization. The end-state of being eaten by software is artisanization.

Failure debt: All the failures you’ve avoided, coming due in one big failure.

The world can absurdum longer than you can reductio

Interesting how sadness in the environment has to aestheticized to be made socially acceptable to experience (goth/emo culture, minor chords in music, wabi sabi, beautiful graveyards). We don’t like banal sadness like empty airport terminals late night with no services open

Most people suck at sales/marketing because they like to connect individually to others. If you’re selling something, even 1:1, it’s usually best to appeal to a group identity.

Tired: people only buy 2 things, happiness and solutions to problems

Wired: People only buy belonging

First they ignore you, then they ignore you, then they ignore you, then they ignore you, then you die.

My biggest disagree-but-commit position is that the AGI people are deeply and entirely wrong at the foundations about every philosophical question but will still invent the next era of computing.

Your warnings and cautions to others often say more about your weaknesses and vulnerabilities than about elements in the threat environment others should be particularly wary of.

Ok people I’m sick of boring views of your damn sourdough experiments, cute parenting moments etc. Do something larger than domestic scale in ambition even if you have to do it at home. Like a video of you soldering together a small Death Star. Or at least an iron man suit.

You know what would be worse. A weird anticorona virus that forced us to always be in tight huddles always with 6 people less than 6 feet away. In crowds of minimum 50. Except to go to the bathroom. Social closening. That sounds horrifying.

Before enlightenment: chop wood, carry water

After enlightenment: move back to the city, sign up for electricity and water, join a gym, and download a meditation app

Selfie sticks are an awful technology. Use a proper drone instead.

What if everybody in the world could vote in any country's elections, with an exponentially decaying weight set by shortest distance from boundary? 

So Chinese people would have say a 1/32 vote in American elections? 

Fourier transform global politics.

When you want to let someone finish what they're saying but you disagree with the whole premise of what they're saying, it feels like going into disagreement debt. I often declare bankruptcy and mentally exit before they finish talking. Body follows as soon as politely possible.

I have the shortest version of my critique of GDPR

It is continent-scale virtue signaling

It is a category error to apply the adjective “broken” to a complex system. Complicated systems break. Complex systems merely enter hostile configurations relative to you. They’re not fixed by your functional expectations. They’re still working. Just not for you.

The “panic now, it’s all melting down” tribe and “lol nothing’s happening, chill” tribes are in a mutual gaslighting equilibrium

Me, I’m above these simplistic either/or things, I’m in a complex superposition of chilling and panicking.

Debate: a mechanism for classical liberals to converge on each other in the belief that they are converging on the truth.

The paradox of exceptionalism. The more exceptional you believe your nation is, the more typical you make it by your behaviors. Exceptionalists are the most universal and predictable subspecies of nationalist.

You become capable of evil when you discover one other person whom you consider both weaker than you, and morally inferior to you. Someone you feel you can righteously hurt without feeling guilt. 

Innocence ends the moment you think you’ve met someone you can judge and punish.

Easily the least compassionate people I’ve ever met are those who’ve broken out of bad circumstances by individual effort. The depth of their contempt and hatred towards those still stuck in prisons they’ve broken out of is astounding. Exit guilt or something.

Sometimes I get distressing glimpses of how old age is going to suck.

Your future is already here. It's just unevenly distributed across your body.

You manage for productivity with incentives (carrots and sticks)

You manage for excellence with esteem and room for self-actualization

You manage for mediocrity with steady evolutionary pressure via automation

Never work 100% within an ideology. Once you do something *successful* that partially defines a party line, the party line will totally define you, and people will approach you with a “derp or beef” filter.

Success insurance: Always color at least a little outside of all lines.

When I snap out of procrastination, it is *never* by willing myself to be a better person. It is always some sort of breakthrough. It almost invariably turns out that my brain decided to wait for a good reason.

Automation is the art of replacing one person doing a full-time job with a thousand people doing 5-minute software admin tasks every few months (6 minutes if you forgot your password).

can't believe I can shitpost all day and nobody can stop me

if I'd tried this before the internet on a street corner, they'd have had me taken away

Medicine has a good term, “Idiopathic” to mean “we have no clue what’s going on, but we’re still the experts you should defer to”. It indicates an expert ignorance

All fields need a term like that.

How about we use “cryptodynamic” for matters of expert engineering ignorance?

"Artificial Intelligence" is a "horseless-carriage" grade anachronism. I hereby declare AI now = "Alienized Infrastructure". You're welcome.

geodysphoria: unhappiness living wherever you are and wanting to move and settle somewhere else indeterminate

Eff it, Yolo, I’m not waiting to see how Gen Z actually shapes up to tag them. Where’s the fun in data-driven hindsight. I’m calling it early based on early markers and portents

If Millennials are Premium Mediocre...

Yeah you heard it here first

## 2. R. K. Laxman and Bearing Witness

*January 26, 2015*

1/ Let's talk about a deceptively simple-seeming concept: to bear witness.

2/ To testify is an after-the-event act. To bear witness is a broader behavior that includes how you are present within an event

3/ You can act or intervene in an event, but the simplest way to bear witness is to simply not look away, and be seen to see.

4/ This is power. If you see somebody being harassed in the subway and look straight at the act instead of away, you bear witness.

5/ When you bear witness, you force the enacted narrative to reflect on itself, without saying a word.

6/ This is why the characteristic phrase of a bully feeling threatened by someone bearing witness is "what are YOU looking at?"

7/ The power of bearing witness is that you don't need to contest the narrative: the actor being witnessed does it himself.

8/ Through your silent, "I see you," you force the actor to acknowledge that they are knowingly enacting a false narrative.

9/ I rarely do eulogies, but this was what R. K. Laxman was: someone who bore witness through his work.

10/ His character, The Common Man, never spoke in the cartoons. He was simply present, looking on bemusedly.

11/ Laxman was not the greatest comic. His jokes were not always funny. But The Common Man was a masterful invention.

12/ The political rhetoric of post-Independence India was ALL about 'aam aadmi': The Common Man.

13/ From Nehru to Modi and Kejriwal, all have presumed to speak for the Common Man.

14/ Laxman did not challenge this presumption directly by giving the Common Man a critical or satirical voice.

15/ Instead, he simply mirrored the hypocrisies and bullshit of the political classes by having his character bear witness to it.

16/ This is what made Laxman _the_ cartoonist of post-independence India.

17/ He was not always the most politically astute. To those who do not understand his milieu, he can appear somewhat tame.

18/ His cartoon commentary was not radical. It was even pedestrian at times. But the Common Man elevated every gag panel to sublime.

19/ Laxman knew this, as his writings show. He did not claim political genius or astuteness. He knew his power lay in bearing witness

20/ In a deep way, my own writing, while lacking the brevity of cartoons, is about bearing witness. I learned that from Laxman.

21/ You need no genius to bear witness, nor great insight. Just the willingness to stay present and not look away.

22/ You do not need to even understand or challenge what is going on. The witnessed will challenge themselves.

22/ RIP R. K. Laxman, 1921-2015. The First Witness of modern India.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._K._Laxman

## 3. Antimanifestos

*October 19, 2015*

1/ Manifesto: beliefs you treat as self-evident, and ideally bury in subconscious as habits of mind.

2/ Antimanifesto: contradictions that have your active attention, that you steer by.

3/  Eg manifesto item: "...[G]lobal civilization faces a new breed of cataclysm." (from #accelerate http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/)

4/ Example antimanifesto item: "Truth vs happiness" from my philosopher's abacus: http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/06/30/the-philosophers-abacus/

5/ Manifestos are way more popular than antimanifestos. Mine is in fact the only antimanifesto I know of.

6/ Good reason for this. If you act on the basis of certainty to seek more certainty, manifestos speed you up, antimanifestos slow you down.

7/ On the other hand, if you act on the basis of doubt to seek out greater doubts, antimanifestos speed you up, manifestos slow you down.

8/ When driven by a manifesto, you try to converge to a fully certain utopia, when driven by an antimanifesto, you diverge into a mystery

9/ A manifesto defines a finite game by inducing rules, an antimanifesto characterizes an infinite game like a fingerprint

10/ The underlying drive of a manifesto is social connection. The underlying drive of an antimanifesto is individual curiosity.

11/ Before now, I hadn't connected my antipathy to manifestos to my preference for divergent exploration. They are 2 sides of the same coin.

12/ Ms and AMs can co-exist and productively interact, but to seek synthesis is actually to try and colonize antimanifestos with manifestos

13/ Furiously resisting *attempts* at synthesis, however, turns an antimanifesto into a manifesto (*cough* libertarians *cough*)

14/ To follow an antimanifesto is to accept both convergence and divergence w/o resistance, while noting that divergence prevails over time

15/ To follow a manifesto on the other hand, you eventually have to actively resist divergence.

16/ Poirot is an archetypal antimanifesto-ist. He only promises to uncover the truth, not to save people. Truth trumps social connection.

17/ This is deep reason manifestos are explicit, but antimanifestos rarely are. Where truth prevails, divergence kills manifestos naturally

18/ To force the convergence that a manifesto requires, you will eventually need to deny truths, even if you don't lie to yourself overtly.

19/ I'm increasingly convinced that societies are not based on shared lies. They merely cannot be based on shared truths.

20/ The DNA of a society can be found in the nature and length of its growing denials, not its static manifestos.

## 4. Epsilon-Delta thinking

*August 30, 2016*

The true antithesis of 0 to 1 is not 1 to n; that's a strawman. The true antithesis is ε to δ: the evolutionary adjacent possible...

Ironically 0 to 1 (understood as coin toss) is conceptual atom of statistics/indeterminacy, ε/δ is conceptual atom of calculus/determinacy

Contra Thiel, the key distinction between stats/calculus is not indeterminate/determinate, but discrete/continuous http://blakemasters.com/post/23435743973/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-13-notes

Stats is intuitive in discrete (dice, coins, balls in urns), unintuitive in continuous. Calculus is opposite. This has deep effects.

Calculus being more natural on continuum means discrete realities feel like approximations. You try to go more fine-grained for better truth

Calculus is more fundamentally indeterminate view of the world: zoom in enuf (and you can do so infinitely in continuous), more bits appear

Stats on the other hand, leads naturally to determinacy through finiteness. Like discrete set of futures with countable branching structure

Of course, at limit, this gets to philosophical imponderables like quantum scale, or digital vs. regular physics.

You get misled when you cherry pick example like predictability of space orbits as "proof" of precise predictability of calculus world.

Try Navier-Stokes equations (also calculus!) for predicting turbulent fluid flow. Opposite of predictable.

Equally, stats can lead to highly predictable results, as in dominant game theoretic strategies over long iteration horizons.

Not nerd-quibbling with Thiel's model for no good reason. This has serious implications for mental models on the Thiel 2x2.

The motivation for that 2x2 is to talk about luck and success as constructed by society, but the account is simplistic.

ε/δ thinking gets at a more fundamental question: when do small changes lead to small effects, versus huge, rapid, snowball effects?

## 5. Riff on Ambition

*August 2, 2017*

1/ So slightly more structured follow-on to this unstructured riff on ambition https://twitter.com/vgr/status/892782925279707136

2/ A good unit for ambition is "baby equivalents." We already talk figuratively of projects as "babies", so why not formalize intuition

3/ It is traditional in the US today to measure babies in terms of how much they cost ($1 million for middle class baby through college)

4/ But this is the wrong way around. Children are the measure of economics-priced things, not the other way around.

5/ One child is basically a certain fraction of no-strings/no-preset-budget time/quality attention allocation for rest of life

6/ Memetic children have higher infant mortality rate, but the principle is the same. I'd guess one childbirth (for men)= writing 3 books

7/ Not all projects are ambition vehicles, or comparable to children. Close-ended projects  with end date are not like children.

8/ The reason a book is like a child is that *if* it succeeds enough, it is an indefinite demand on your attention

9/ A flop book, or a mercenary/tactical book for which you have no ambitions beyond a seasonal fad harvest is like an child that dies young

10/ More calibration. An ordinary startup is like 1 child. If it grows into unicorn, it's like 3-4 kids for the founder if they stay with it

11/ Political ambitions I think are higher. A local election bid is like 1 child if you win. National-level is like 2. President=10

12/ The trick to baby equivalent things is that *if* they succeed, they demand particular levels of attention/commitment for rest of life

13/ So we actually bring the same kind of thinking to managing ambition as we do to child-rearing and ask similar questions

14/ How much will it cost? Is it sick? Will it go to college? How many can I afford to have?

15/ Answering my own q about why we lower sights through life in general if we're not winning egregiously, baby-economics provides answer

16/ Merely making money is a close-ended problem to be solved, whether your horizon is the next month, the next year or retirement stash

17/ A baby or baby-equivalent though is an open-ended commitment where it only makes sense if you are willing to plan for success

18/ It is fine to view paychecks as just a close-ended way to pay bills. It's dumb *not* to wish a book to be open-ended success

19/ Similarly, close-ended "3x flip in 2 years" startup logic doesn't work for same reason "have baby and kill it at age 3" doesn't work

20/ So ambition is best understood as your personal process of budgeting for *open-ended* commitments through life, predicated on success

21/ Fewer people found startups at 40 than 25 (though more who do succeed) same reason fewer people have kids late (bio clock aside)...

22/ You rationally estimate that your available rest-of-life open-ended best-case attention budget for "one more kid" gets lower with age

23/ So to summarize: measure your ambitions in baby-equivalent units and take on what you think you can actually raise if successful

24/ Oh, and one more thing... the way you compute ambition is marginal, same as kids. "Can I afford 1 more kid?" is always the question.

25/ PS: choosing not to have kids/being anti-natalist is familiar.There is also choosing to have no memetic kids/being memetic-anti-natalist

26/ Okay I'm not done. Couple more points. First r/K selection applies to baby-equivs too. Deep invest in 1 or shallow invest in 10 babies?

27/ And finally, there's male (sperm) and female (egg+incubation) cheap/costly attitudes towards kid-equiv projects.

28/ Many of both genders bring "deadbeat dad" sensibilities to baby-equiv projects (monorail!). Doesn't work unless someone plays mom.

## 6. Healing the Wounds of History

*August 13, 2017*

1/ Vipassana-ing friend of mine said deep thing about wounds of history: someone has to experience repressed/deferred pain for it to go away

2/ There is a Genghis Khan statue in Mongolia. He's still central to their identity https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan_Equestrian_Statue

3/ In India, people are *still* trying to rewrite history to paint Hindu losers of battles with Muslims from 13th, 16th centuries as victors

4/ By global festering-wound standards, the legacy of Robert E. Lee has not even scabbed over. This will take a LONG time to process.

5/ I don't believe in afterlife type karma, but there is such a thing as historical karma. It exists because full erasure is impossible

6/ No matter what your politics, Robert E. Lee existed and means something in the stories some people need to tell themselves to go on

7/ So does Hitler. There may be no big statues of him, but he remains a potent symbol in global history-writing. Live cultural currency.

8/ Beyond the historical specifics of their stories, heroes of alt-histories like Hitler and Lee are like currencies: of blood debts

9/ Today Genghis Khan is a healed wound for the most part, not an active cultural currency. We are free to view him as pure history data

10/ Why? Because the debts have been largely paid. The pains have been experienced over 8 centuries.

11/ But there is a ton of outstanding pain debt left to be experienced in history books, before it can be retired. Dark matter. Work to do.

12/ People approach the healing work differently depending on their spiritual bent. Christians seek to repent/forgive. Buddhists "process".

13/ Atheist techies are not immune. We frantically try to create more clean future so blood debts of history become trivial by comparison

14/ Whatever your coping strategy as a historically situated ape looking for meaning in aging rivers of blood flowing past scabs/wounds...

15/ ...One thing is for sure. The pain must be experienced in consciousness before it can be expiated from it.

16/ Denying this is dangerous for the same reason denying finanicial debt is dangerous: there is compound interest at work

17/ Compound interest so powerful that a 147 years after Lee died, a 20-year-old felt the need to drive a car into a crowd over his statue

18/ Do not ignore the blood debts of history (with interest). Do not lie to yourself that pains can be buried without being experienced.

19/ This shit has caused me pain in 2 countries/histories.  Your share of debt can't be willed away with clever thinking or 'enlightenment'

20/ Its not about you. It's about building roads into history that allow us to visit past painlessly. Just as taxes are about physical roads

## 7. Boundary Intelligence

*October 3, 2017*

1/ I'd like to make up a theory of intelligence based on a 2-element ontology: boundary and interior intelligence

2/ Boundary intelligence is how you deal with information flows across the boundary of your processing abilities

3/ Interior intelligence is how you process information. Includes logic, emotional self-regulation, etc.

4/ A thesis I've been converging on is that boundary intelligence is VASTLY more consequential once interior intelligence exceeds a minimum

5/ Boundary intelligence is by defn meta, since you're tuning your filters and making choices about what to even let hit your attention

6/ I think it is highly consequential because almost all risk management happens via boundary intelligence (blindspots, black swans etc)

7/ Interior intelligence is your poker skill and strategy. Boundary intelligence is picking which table to sit down at

8/ Interior intelligence is reading a book competently, extracting insights and arguments. Boundary intelligence is picking books to read.

9/ Interior intelligence is being a good listener. Boundary intelligence is deciding whom to listen to.

10/ Basically, better input plus mediocre IQ beats bad input and genius IQ every time, so boundary intelligence is leverage

11/ And obviously, boundary intelligence is more sensitive to context. The noisier and angrier info streams get, the more BI beats II

12/ Most of boundary intelligence has to do with input intelligence, but output intelligence becomes more important with higher agency

13/ Output intelligence is basically the metacognition around when/where/how/to-whom/why to say or do things you are capable of saying/doing

14/ We think a lot about external factors in decisions, but output intelligence is about freedom left after you've dealt with external part

## 8. Unboxing in Unbundling

*October 9, 2017*

1/ A neglected aspect of software-driven unbundling is unboxing: the elimination of a containing element in an old bundle

2/ Unboxing and reboxing constitutes a bigger proportion of unbundling the more abstract the product. At the limit boxes = institutions.

3/ When music gets unbundled/unboxed from albums to songs, containing/support elements at the "album" level (jewelcases, liner notes) vanish

4/ When books get unbundled into serialized blog posts, prefaces, indices, cover art and (for physical copies) bindings vanish

5/ What is interesting about these elements is that they often embody a lot of the socialization and transaction cost logic of a thing

6/ Gold/platinum records, autographing of copies of books, credit attributions, pricing tiers, access control, security etc are at box level

7/ As a first approximation, the box value vs. content value reflects the transaction costs vs. cost of the product/service

8/ Even better, the box-cost as a proxy for transaction costs actually captures a lot of illegible tx costs beyond explicit Coase ones

9/ Box-cost includes, besides search/negotiation/monitoring costs, such intangibles as memetic socialization, pricing psychology etc etc

10/ Okay, all this is a set up for what I actually want to talk: organizations. These things are *primarily* boxes. They're like Coke/Pepsi

11/ About 150 years ago, if you wanted to drive societal change through institutions, you'd fund things like universities: "mission boxes"

12/ The boxes got smaller and smaller. Institutional ambitions went from nation-state level to university level, to lab level

13/ At some point, rather than get smaller, institutional ambitions began manifesting in unboxed forms and calling themselves "networks"

14/ Institutional forms didn't suddenly "discover" networks as an organizing structure. They merely unboxed them and allowed them to connect

15/ Example: founders of w00w00, the hacker collective, cited Xerox PARC as an inspiration. PARC was a network in a leaky box, w00w00=no box

16/ Here's something we don't yet know: where do the box-level attributes/features of institutional landscapes go? There is no simple answer

17/ Unlike unbundling/rebundling of content/functionality, which is relatively lossless, unboxing/reboxing tends to be extremely lossy

18/ Some "box" functions migrate to interior. Bibliographic references of books turn into hot links inside the text. Indices become search.

19/ But many are lost. Since a lot of the logic contained in box layer serves longer-term meta-functions, you don't notice till too late

20/ One sign is shifting patterns in institutional funding. Unboxing is often accompanied by big cost reductions. Not all is wastecutting

21/ When you fund a project instead of an institution that will undertake the project, for instance, you make it less sustainable

22/ Indirect cost support (the ~50% overhead univs get for government research funding) was important historically because it was box money

23/ Indirect cost support *created* the research university after WW II. It didn't happen by magic. Something deinstitutionalizers don't get

24/ There is a tendency to believe that Internet can magically substitute for box-level functions in organic/emergent ways. True and false.

25/ True part: Self-organizing systems can evolve the right structures to capture any kind of value a top-down designed "box" can

26/ False part: they can do so at zero cost. When you unbox and rebox the research university, you don't have to create a new kind of box...

27/ But your "emergent box" (for example, fora like arXiv) do need the equivalent of indirect cost support flowing towards them somehow

28/ A broad way to understand this is that the Internet, as an institutional stack base-layer, lacks indirection/persistence dynamics

29/ So while I'm all for de-institutionalizing the Industrial Age and its dinosaur institutions, I'm skeptical that it will be lossless

30/ The Internet is not institutional magic-sauce. It can't create something out of nothing, or costlessly store/embody stuff.

31/ The net needs financial plumbing to fuel network-mode reboxing that can persist value of no immediate value but that we'll regret losing

32/ "Reboxing" is the wrong term actually. Unboxing is the right term for the destruction process, but the creation process deals in flows

33/ We need flow metaphors for reboxing. Something like adding insulating layers to pipes or something. Not entirely sure where to take that

## 9. On Online Teaching

*April 20, 2018*

1/ Quick thought about teaching activities in the free agent world by analogy to academia.

In academia most faculty enjoy teaching graduate courses and PhD seminars, but only a few enjoy teaching major undergrad “service” courses (like say Stats 101 or English 101).

2/ Why? Because grad+ courses massively benefit the teacher’s research. I designed and taught one such as a postdoc at Cornell back in 2006, and learned far more than I ever did as a student.

Undergrad service courses otoh, mainly teach logistics/presentation/packaging skills

3/ It’s the enterprise/consumer difference: bespoke teaching relationships with 5-10 adults versus, mass-produced ones with 50 or 500 (let’s face it) kids. 

I never taught UG courses but I TA’ed many large UG classes. I did learn a lot, but not things I was *looking* to learn.

4/ The free-agent world is developing its own maturing educational activities. A distinction is emerging between people who put together courses for things like SEO/SEM, Blogging 101, Productivity 101, etc. which are like UG service courses, and weird “grad seminar” types.

5/ In this world btw, the zillions of hours of great YouTube instructional videos are like K-12. It’s great and free since you mostly can’t charge for it.

6/ But anyway, though I’ve done a bunch of teaching/online course experiments, I’ve realized something: I really don’t like teaching the equivalent of “undergrad service courses”. 

I’m not good at it, and don’t care to learn the skills (logistics, scale, packaging) it teaches.

7/ But the opportunity to design/teach grad school type things that would advance your own research/writing projects is severely supply limited. 

People who could use it are mostly already at real grad schools, taking seminars from Real Tenured Faculty ™

8/ So the interesting challenge for the free-agent world is to develop the equivalent of grad school run by Fake, Untenured, Nonfaculty ™

I jokingly call this the “Not Even a Diploma Mill” problem.

9/ If we leave out “new economy” service/101 type courses, what’s left? Two kinds of educational material.

1. Things that compete directly with graduate school on cost (1/10th) but don’t offer “extras”

2. “Weird” topics that would never get taught in universities at all

10/ Many of us could teach the equivalent of an MBA level marketing or org psych course at 1/10th the cost. Maybe with some boutique idiosyncrasies.

But then you take such courses for the Stanford/MIT networks, not the material). The material is pretty DIY+experience tbh.

11/ That leaves Weird Topics as the ideal market for a free agent grad-school type world of courses. @sarahdoingthing and I tried one such, an idiosyncratic ribbonfarm writing course that was neither Writing 101, nor Blogging 101, nor graduate creative writing at a univ.

12/ It was great and I think we learned far more than any of the participants, which I how it should be for grad-seminar type teaching.

I have many lazy ideas, based on my writing,  for other Weird Topics grad-level courses (thinking with 2x2s, OODA loopology, fat thinking...)

13/ The challenge is working out a systematic business model for delivering Weird Topics learning material from the Long Tail of the Great Weirding. 

My experiments so far have been Random Acts of Mildly Profitable or Break-Even Teaching, and I don’t trust that to be sustainable

14/ What’s missing is a clean conceptualization of how Weird Topics teaching directly links to research/writing/making/kickstartering end of things. Just like there’s Aman R&D/PhD/grad-coursework nexus in academia.

Once I figure that out I’ll be more enthusiastic about teaching

15/ This thread is a reflection of my own ambivalence towards the online courses game. 

I have had a Ribbonfarm School set up on teachable for a year now with some bare minimum stuff available, and I’m both attracted to/put off by the idea of doing more.

16/ What would make me get serious is if I could figure out a good model, with many teachers, of Ribbonfarm School as a Weird Topics grad school.

I have no interest in the undergrad-equivalent stuff (though I need that to exist) or things that univs do well already at grad level

17/ Btw if any of you are interested in this stuff and looking to “disrupt” regular grad school or even undergrad, note that that’s likely a bad idea. 

They’re disrupting themselves pretty well with their free/cheap catalog-openings in partnership with the Courseras of the world

18/ What we’re talking about here is really an indie teaching scene by analogy to indie music. The big univs are like the big record labels. No point competing where they have a deep back catalog of material ready to go.

Either teach New Economy UG or Weird Topics grad school

19/ If you want to teach New Economy UG, you have to think like a consumer business and design for scale, efficiency, packaging, mass marketing, intake funnels, and probably a sub $300 price range

20/ If you want to teach Weird Topics grad school, you need to figure out a link/cross-subsidy with research/writing/making/indie-creating, focus on bespoke teaching relationships, and a price < $100, unless you can figure out a scholarship model and make it free (my preference)

## 10. Big Skies, Big Cities

*April 30, 2018*

1/ This long piece by @JamesFallows is a brave and partly successful attempt at a positive reading of the zeitgeist. Some comments https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/reinventing-america/556856/

2/ I'm going to call Fallows' thesis the "Little Sky Country" optimist narrative, I think that label says more than the title of his upcoming book, "Our Towns: A 100,000-Mile Journey Into the Heart of America"

3/ Fallows' thesis is one part Tocqueville (energetic travel criss-crossing America to get the "real America" story) and one part "Our Town" in a Thornton Wilder sense.

4/ The headline "finding" as it were, is that the zeitgeist is much more positive at a local resolution than global. People are being more resourceful, agent-y, and pragmatic locally, on every subject from education and economic revitalization to race relations and immigration.

5/ You get the sense that Fallows is trying to play Tocqueville to Trump's Andrew Jackson (it is interesting that Tocqueville visited and wrote (1831-35) during Jackson's tenure (1829-1837).

6/ It appears to be an attempt at an oblique counter-programming of Trumpism. But I'm not sure it entirely works, and the problem is the fact that this is a "Little Sky Country" thesis.

America is "Big Sky Country" and 100,000 Little Skies don't add up to a Big Sky.

7/ While Fallows doesn't deny the reality of the toxicity of national level discourse, he appears to think it either doesn't matter too much, or that Little Sky Country thriving will defeat it.

8/ Just two examples: venture capital and reverse migration trends, which Fallows treats as evidence for the potential of Little Sky Country.

9/ Unfortunately, VC has not shown much potential for thriving at smaller-than-SV scales. It is a model that relies on scaled concentration of capital. Almost all attempts to replicate SV at smaller scale fail badly.

10/ Similarly, reverse migration may be driven by high cost of living in coastal cities, but the fact that it is occurring due to economic pressure, doesn't mean that it is a good thing. In fact, I think it is not. Big cities need fixing.

11/ A strong case could be made that big, dense, urban cores are going to remain economic (and increasingly, climate-response) engines. Reverse migration driven by big-city problems actually delay the return of economic vitality and climate sustainability.

12/ The deeper problem with Little Sky Country optimism is that it has Jeffersonian axioms, while the economy still has Hamiltonian axioms. Ie, the "Real America" today is NOT Little Sky Country at all, but the Big Sky part.

13/ The Big Sky part is not just a bunch of toxic conversations and partisan discourses in DC and the media. It is not ephemera on top of the sum-of-little-towns populated by self-absorbed WHCD attendees.

14/ This is where the analogy to 1831 breaks down. Trump = Jackson, Fallows = Tocqueville, but 1831 economy != 2018 economy. 

1831 was peak Jefferson, trough Hamilton. 2018 is the exact opposite.

15/ I laid out this thesis in my 2015 Aeon article, American Cloud. https://aeon.co/essays/america-still-has-a-heartland-it-s-just-an-artificial-one

16/ This means a) that the problems at Big Sky Country level are FAR more consequential than just some discourse toxicity, and b) Little Sky Country ain't gonna save us.

17/ The core issue here is where you think American strength truly lies: in the romanticized Tocqueville small-town yeomanry with its storied highlight moments like the homesteading movement? (Jeffersonianism)

Or the talent for scale? (Hamiltonianism)

18/ I think the evidence of history is unequivocal. The *average* mediocre gold-rushing, land-grabbing, manifest-destinying American contributed far less to America's greatness than the Hamiltonian types who dreamed Big Sky dreams.

19/ From the mass manufacturing revolution at Springfield and Harper's Ferry, through the wartime mobilization, to the Internet and Apollo, America's great contributions have been, well, Big things involving massively large-scale collaboration.

Not narcissistic homesteading.

20/ And perhaps no greater Big Sky project exists in America than the great coastal cities. The Interstate system of the human soul, if I may be forgiven a bit poetry.

21/ I mean, I'm sympathetic to the plight of the little guy, seeking his (and it's mostly men) little homestead-scale American dream, and wish him all the best in carving out a little place to call his own in the emerging economic landscape...

22/ And certainly, as it always has in history, Little Sky country will serve as the source of Big Sky dreamers (like Robert Noyce from Iowa to SV), who have always left the "heartland" to migrate to places where Big Sky thinking is appreciated, enabled, and rewarded.

23/ But I think it is dangerous to let this instinct of kindness towards small dreams lead us towards overstating the importance or history-shaping potential of that cultural force. 

America has simply never worked that way. It's just a comforting myth for a lot of Americans.

24/ Obviously, I haven't read Fallows' book since it isn't out yet, and I'm totally behind the attempt to provide a healing, positive narrative of local agency and empowerment to a forgotten/ignored demographic.

25/ But bottomline: America isn't Little Sky country. 100,000 locally flourishing little Thornton Wilder tales don't add up to a new kind of American mass flourishing.

The problem is with Big Sky country, and the solution needs to be found there.

## 11. Borders and Bridges

*June 23, 2018*

1/ Tricky question: what is the opposite of a “border”? The typical fearful-right idea of a non-border is a vague fear of a massive flood of people, suggesting a dam-like containment of pressure. The idea of developing world “overpopulation” encourages this mental model.

2/ This sort of human flooding does happen on occasion, but generally it takes an unbelievable kind of pressure. The India-Pakistan partition is an example. 5 million flooded in 1 direction, 6 million in the other, with 1 million dead.

3/ But this sort of massive social disruption is rare. In practice borders are places where you disconnect from one social graph to connect to another. Usually via a social “bridge” like a migration “chain”.

4/ Humans are far more social than we realize. Migration is not isolated atomized things flowing anarchically along a pressure gradient. It is more like a careful, minimal kind of making and breaking of bonds.

5/ Even under extreme stress — climate, war, ethnic cleansing — humans try to move in ways that preserve as much social graph integrity as they can, and quickly create new graph connections to replace lost ones. It’s like osmosis or electrical charge conduction.

6/ In fact “flood” like refugee crises are generally trying to flee conditions that break bonds and atomize humans. The abstract flow gradient is from graph-tending to graph-preserving places.

7/ Since most of the land on the planet is claimed behind some border, border bound territories tend to be co-extensive with high integrity graphs. The “dam and flood” metaphor is really bad at capturing this. It’s more like piles of spaghetti in a 2-compartment container.

8/ A normal human border is not a dumb partition but a sort of graph theoretic transformation function where trade in graph capital happens, like forex transactions. You show social capital in one subgraph to show you can transition beneficially to another.

9/ So to answer my original question, the opposite of a border is a sort of graph-destroying, alienating, identity-erasing interstitial place. Social graph terra terra nullius. People abandoned by all social graphs. People fallen through cracks.

10/ You know the best place to find an unborder? It’s not at national borders but in the hearts of cities, which are full of what I call human graph garbage, in both computer science and social senses. People cut off from all social graphs.

11/ Around the world, refugee communities are known for stronger than normal graph integrity, not weaker. They may be geographically homeless but they are socially the opposite of homeless. They are like arks.

12/ That’s why they form ethnic enclaves with weirdly narrow versions of their origin cultures. There is a reason “Indian” food in the US is mostly Punjabi food. Or why half the Uber drivers in Seattle are Ethiopian or Somalian.

13/ My point with this thread is not to provide any specific commentary on the border crap going on now but to point out that the “order keeping out chaos” mental model of ethnonationalism is really really toxic and sociological nonsense.

14/ With climate change pressure this sort of thing is going to get far worse, not better. So if we don’t upgrade our mental models of migration, we risk destroying vast amounts of cultural capital trying to preserve itself.

15/ All the varied cuisines you can enjoy in any major city are just the tip of the iceberg of what gets saved/preserved/redundantly replicated through migration. This is planetary scale distributed computation on an unreliable hard drive.

16/ I think most countries in the world have some understanding of this: that for thousands of years the world has been based on a system of interdependent cultural capital insurance against local disruptions that relies on migration calculus

17/ I suspect American-born natives don’t get the enormous value of this system because they’ve so far enjoyed a history bereft of outbound migration memories/narratives. It’s only inbound Ellis island stuff which makes them feel benevolent.

18/ The 2 domestic migration stories most Americans know — Underground Railroad and Grapes of Wrath — just don’t convey the significance and richness of population movements in human history. Americans have never had to*leave* America in large numbers.

19/ To me this means this is not a nation of immigrants. It is a nation that is built on remembering only the “gracious host” side of one half of immigration: arrivals. The US has NO sense of departures.

20/ First-generation immigration stories are only half-told because they half-heard. Americans ask, “why did you come to America?” expecting to hear flattering things about their own society. They are rarely curious about the stories of departures. Why?

21/ I know why: the unspoken assumption is “well of course you wanted to leave because it’s a shithole country compared to Great America, who wouldn’t?”

22/ So curiously, even as immigrant stories get woven into the American story, it’s curiously half-woven. Except for Albion’s Seed people who supply an origin myth, no other story is welcome in the American grand narrative.

23/ So is it any surprise that American culture is curiously isolationist and not in any sort of real dialogue with other cultures? Even the tightest and most unavoidable of dialogues — with Spanish culture — is one sided.

24/ Hell, on the west coast, despite all the  Spanish names and obvious signs that the base layer here is Spanish (there are is;ands near *Seattle* called San Juan islands for a reason), the remarkable mythology here is that Hispanics are the aliens.

25/ You don’t even have to go as far as talking about Native American cultures to note the fundamentally brutal erasure-oriented nature of American culture. Americanism in that respect is like a harsh young religion, like Christianity or Islam in their early centuries.

26/ You dont so much migrate to America as you convert under pressure, subtle or not, to Americanism. Often due to dynamics set in motion by American economic evangelism and crusading worldwide.

27/ This is a terribly impoverished way to inhabit the planet. For 300 years, the excuse was geographic isolation. Today that’s no excuse.

28/ I’m particularly distressed and sensitive to this stuffbecause I’m *not* a “crisis” migrant. My parents live in India, I’m free to go back and forth, stay as connected as I want, have the best of both worlds.*I know what crisis-migrants lose because I still have it*

29/ So when I see America being cruel to people who are at high risk of losing half of their cultural beings, it feels like a spectacle of willful cultural violence and really bad global citizenship.

30/ It feels especially selfish coming from a country that could wage 2 world wars and a Cold War at a safe remove and then reshape entire continents to its liking in the aftermath, without even gaining the label of “colonial power”

31/ For almost 100 years, America has been free to take the best of the rest of the world, be mostly insulated from troubles caused both by itself and other powers. Arrange a planet’s worth of raw materials, carbon-sink forests, markets etc for its benefit.

32/ And now it has the gall to act like the injured exploited party, take its resources and retreat behind its isolationist borders, loudly claiming it is the rest of the world that is “ungrateful”? Takes a very special, heavily edited sense of world history to do that.

22a addendum/ Basically every microstory of immigration is read in a self-serving, other-demonizing way by Americans, so of course the world looks like a demonic place delivering half-demons to the shores, some of whom are to be “saved” and “redeemed” by evangelical Americanism

## 12. Against Waldenponding (original)

*October 4, 2018*

1/ Lemme do a 1-slide presentation since I'm feeling job sick. Title: How to Actually Manage Attention Without Smashing Your Phone and Retreating to a Log Cabin

2/ Premise: FOMO is good. Being plugged in is good. There is valuable info at all levels from twitter gossip to philosophy books. You should stay plugged in. You can manage anxiety and beat the House without resorting to shaming social platforms into managing attention for you.

3/ Inspiration from 2 sources

a) Quote "small minds discuss people, average minds discuss events, great minds discuss ideas" ( = y axis)

b) Richard Hamming idea in of scheduling "Great Thoughts" calendar time in You and Your Research http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html

4/ What the "unplug for self-care" crowd doesn't get is that you are part of a giant social computer computing the future. The level and latency at which you consume information and bet on it determines your "job" in the social computer. Your shitposting and FOMO are functional.

5/ The reason the unplugging doesn't work for most people is not that the Evil Platform Companies are trying to hack your attention and turn you into a helpless addict (though they are) but because you rationally realize YOU NEED A JOB IN THE SOCIAL COMPUTER.

6/ If you don't manage your information economy career, you will default to the lowest level job in the social computer: processing very low-latency information with small-minded cognition (bottom left) for small bets. It's the equivalent of low-level bug reporting/testing.

7/ The way to manage your attention is not to "unplug" or do some sort of bullshit Classical Liberal virtue signaling crap of "I only read ancient greek authors" but to be sensitive to your mind quality and consciously target the zone, moving fluidly between small/great mind.

8/ There are THREE ways to fail at this.

a) Thinking you can be Great Minded all the time.

b) Trying to be Great Minded on low latency information diet (upper left red box)

c) Trying to consume high-latency information diet without aspiring to more than small-minded thoughts

9/ The first failure mode manifests as trying to consume only information at your target level. Like only reading Economist and journal papers and trying to produce in institutional modes. This will fail. You need some information diet input from ALL levels to work at ANY level

10/ The second failure mode manifests as saving ALL your time for Great Thoughts. Even Hamming only saved Friday afternoons for Great Thoughts. 

Give yourself permission to inhabit any mind level from small-minded shitposter to philosophy book reader/writer

11/ The final failure mode is trying to keep up with information at all latencies. Reading every trending tweet and every bestselling big history book and everything in between, but ALL at the same low level (ie as people gossip or play-by-play event tracking). Unsustainable.

12/ Each failure mode is an information diet that leads to patterns of betting that fail to deliver a positive return long-term. It's not addictive FOMOing that kills you, but not being able to translate the information consumption choices you're making into winning bets.

13/ The stable consumption/production positions are along what I've labeled the turnpike (a term borrowed from economics). You can move up and down along the turnpike. Get off the turnpike and your bad returns will start to kill you.

14/ The challenge in executing this turnpike roadmap strategy is that your mind-level chooses you rather than you choosing mind-level. If you choose to be small minded today, that's good. If you find you are always small minded and can't ever break up into mediocre, that's bad

15/ This is a bit like weight training. You have to increase the weights slowly and perhaps train your attention to exhaustion a bit. If you're in small mind zone and can only consume/produce tweets, try an essay. See how far you get. Strength-train attention from 10s to 10min.

16/ Note that this atrophying of attention and latency limits will happen REGARDLESS of whether evil designers are trying to hack your attention and keep you phase-locked into their preferred 10s latency information loop. Their designs are in fact the LOAD you're training against

17/ The fact of the matter is that information distribution has become free/cheap, so the firehose is going to have flows at all timescales and abstraction levels no matter what designers want or don't want. It's the information firehose that's creating this environment.

18/ Blaming/shaming platform UX designers is giving them way too much credit. There's just too much actual information being put out there at too high a rate, and you do in fact have meaningful access to almost all of it.

19/ There is of course a time, place, and role for unplugging from information flows entirely, and doing whatever low/zero information refractory period activity you prefer to recover, from domestic blissing to meditation. Not shown on graph.

20/ But while that has a role to play in mental health, make no mistake: you do need a job in the giant social computer, and that involves consuming and acting on information at all levels on the turnpike, in a temporally constrained way.

21/ The idea of a profane/secular "temporal" plane and a sacred/religious timeless/eternal plane is a medieval idea invented to justify the power of powerful intercessionary religious orgs. Don't reproduce that bad pattern.

22/ LONG before the digital media companies tried to pwn your attention by overloading it at difficult latency ranges, religious institutions tried to pwn you by suckering you into checking out of "temporal" matters by labeling them sinful/profane or whatever. This is utter bs.

23/ That is in fact the original attention hack: powerful religious leaders telling smart people to check out and unplug from information flows. That way, they get the power.

24/ If you think about it, it is very shady indeed that you're supposed to meditation on low-actionable-information information streams like a flickering candle. Good start. But if you stay there, you're playing someone else's game.

25/ If you are a genius who rises to Level 25 Omega Super Adept in a monastery in the mountains, who knows everything there is to know about candle flames, that's kinda... very convenient for the Pope and the King. Smart person out of the way in a log cabin learning Candleology.

26/ A real adept oughta be able to meditate on the angriest, most toxic twitter stream, consume the bile, and turn it into nectar... actionable insight you can bet on in the real world.

27/ A real adept ought to have strength-trained attention so they can spend an hour either reading a tweetstream or a once-in-a-generation history-disrupting philosophy book. No hack designer should be able to lock them down in the 0.1-10 second range.

28/ So stop blaming the media platforms for your own wallowing in small-minded twitter gossip about people. Strength train to the point where you decide whether to be there or elsewhere.

29/ I will now indulge my OCD to get this thread to 30 tweets...

30/ Stop trying to manage your attention and manage your attention Neo. You're in the Matrix now. Some rules can be bent, others can be broken.

## 13. Thinking for Yourself

*October 28, 2018*

In practice “thinking for yourself” =

Being redpilled: Leaving large, loose tribe for small, tight one (60%)

Ignorance-veiling: Maintaining composure and 50-50 bothsides priors about everything (30%)

“Critical thinking” Ritual, absence-of-evidence skepticism (9%)

Real (1%)

Sure, sometimes you independently reach the same conclusions as others. Sure, sometimes you should throw away cached priors and reboot (resurrect) thinking, and sure, sometimes “there is no evidence of that” is the right brake to slam on toxic, hostile speculations...

But primary sign you’re thinking for yourself is that you reach conclusions different from *everybody* else at least *some* of the time, and that these conclusions are more surprising than offensive to others, and recognized as significant by an *unpredictable* group of people

Children, clueless adults, and foreigners sometimes reach different+surprising conclusions, but rarely significant ones. It takes an independent thinking adult to hit the different+surprising+significant trifecta consistently.  More often than could happen by chance.

A different, surprising, significant conclusion drawn from the *same* data as others steers the conversation in a new direction (so do obvious conclusions drawn from *new* data that you get earlier than others, but that’s being ahead of the curve, not ‘thinking for yourself’)

Analogy: new data is like a change in direction caused by a banked turn in the road. It sort of happens anyway, you may not even need to turn the wheel.

A change in direction caused by thinking for yourself is like an overtake on a straight road. Wheel maneuvering required.

The primary quality required to do this is not intelligence, or even imagination (though both are needed), but nerve (a word I’ve come to prefer over ‘boldness’ or ‘courage’ thanks to Arthur C. Clarke failure of imagination < failure of nerve principle).

The key effect of nerve on thinking is that it allows you to see supposedly ‘important’ things as unimportant, and supposedly ‘trivial’ things as crucial. This is why you can get somewhere different despite having the same data. You’re filtering differently.

In Christie’s ‘Lord Edgeware Dies’, clueless Hastings thinks the most important question is ‘Who killed Lord Edgeware?’ while Poirot realizes it is ‘Why didn’t he get the letter mailed by Lady Edgeware?’ The one fact that makes no sense but is filtered out as trivial by others

Classic detective novels are great little illustrations of ‘thinking for yourself’ for this reason. Everybody has roughly same dataset same time, everybody is in an unchanging narrative ‘lane’ with unchanging relative position to others in the same lane.

If Poirot doesn’t do some overtaking, the cops in the faster narrative lane will get to the end first, winning the race with the wrong person hanged. Because they’re simply moving faster with their narrative, not because they have better data. How does Poirot change the ending?

Think about how steering versus staying in your lane works on a straight road. In both cases friction is what allows forward movement, but also produces constant small sideways forces. Going straight = using physics to passively stay pointed ahead.

What actually steers the car is *changing how friction with the road interacts with the movement of the car*. The steering mechanism reorients wheel to redirect friction so that the sideways friction becomes active. This is like paying more attention in a new direction.

The road surface has a “grain” of small irregularities (raw data)  in every direction. Steering is changing narrative lanes by choosing how to filter the grain with rolling tires. Curve-fitting the car’s path to the road surface by working the friction with rolling rubber.

If you think of driving straight on a rough uneven road, the role of known data, importance filtering, staying in narrative lanes, looking more moves ahead, choosing whether to go with a particular uniform flow (social proof) or overtake (think for yourself), all become clearer.

Thinking for yourself is paying relatively more attention to  road than to other cars for overtakes. Bigger irregularities are like counterexamples. Everybody goes around left around the pothole, you go right and gain, and so people behind you go right too. Hey you’re leader now!

Everybody can see the visible road (known data) but minimizes thinking by staying in their narrative lanes, following local social proof leaders who got their roles by their last bit of thinking for themselves. Upcoming turns (new data) are seen by narrative-leaders first.

“Seeking alpha” by being “ahead of the curve” is like overtaking on the turns. The opportunities to do that depend on the macrostructure of the road. Election results, quarterly earnings, results of key upcoming science experiments: these are overtake-on-the-turn opportunities.

But waiting for these turns is a reactive thing. You can only respond to opportunities, not create them. People who can really think for themselves don’t need to wait for the turns. They can overtake on the straights too. Bonus: This also gets them first shot at turn overtakes!

In the analogy this means paying *relatively* more attention to the road than to other cars, compared to other cars. You also have to pay attention to other narratives besides the one you’re flowing with right now because you’re going to weave among them.

If you do it well enough, for long enough, other cars will start following you, and at some point you’ll be leading a faster dynamic narrative weaving among the slower static stay-in-lane ones, slowly gaining a net speed advantage.

The faster you go, the more other cars turn into the territory. They’re just a higher-order kind of road friction to use in fitting your path. Imagination helps you see at this higher-level, as others’ narratives turn into your background.

To get back from the analogy to the conceptual point: thinking for yourself means consistently surprising people with new angles, whether or not there is new data to work with, to the point that others start following you.

You turn into a leader attracting converts from existing narratives, and craft a new one that treats the existing narratives as the terrain. You don’t fit their ideas of ‘lanes’ (tribal partisanship paths) because you are laying dynamic new ‘weaving’ lanes at the next level.

So to think for yourself,  you need intelligence yes, imagination, yes, but mainly you need nerve. And if it works, the willingness to lead. At least for a while.

## 14. Bonus Mentality

*November 4, 2018*

A thread on cultivating an ‘unexpected bonus’ attitude to work that catalyzes actionable insights, discoveries, inventions, and spillover societal value.

Interestingly enough, the trick to this lies in a dilemma within the mundane, everyday problem of valuing effort for pay.

Whether you make money on a salaried, hourly, project-based, or outcome basis, people generally don’t want to pay for either effort OR output. 

They want to pay for *apparent effort visible in  output, with 20/20 hindsight, with no obvious lower-effort paths than the one taken.*

Nerdy point: This is ex-post modal rationality: it’s like conducting a Vickrey (2nd-price) auction of counterfactuals.  Whoever did work “wins” but is paid bid price of the fictitious second-price producer who *could* have done it cheaper with benefit of hindsight shorter path.

So unexpected elegance in output can end up devaluing the effort that went into creating it. 20/20 hindsight represents a *risk* in creative work that leads to imagination inhibition.

And no you can’t prescope discovery: “I will stumble on 2 insights while coding this feature”

This means things that take a complex path to get to but can be vastly simplified with hindsight insights once you’re there — the essence of art+science beyond craft — are systematically undervalued. This is the reason for a lot of obscurantism in presenting the output of work.

The maker’s dilemma: if you DON’T make the obvious simplifications apparent with hindsight, the customer might spot them in the output and think you’re stupid. If you DO make them, they’ll assume you put in less effort than you did, based on the apparent visible effort.

This dilemma is inherent in all types of information work, but especially kinds where there are ‘unreasonable effectiveness/elegance mechanisms’ like math, algorithmic structure, or laws of physics. Hidden “nature’s gift processes” entangled with the work processes.

Sometimes the dilemma is avoided by the essential insight being so non-obvious, you can act on it and reasonably make the case that you couldn’t have anticipated it. But this is often much harder to do than people think. Insights have a bad habit of appearing obvious ex-post.

3 ways to mitigate, 2 bad, 1 good: 

a) Obfuscate potential simplifications and deliver needlessly complex output 😖

b) Obfuscate elegant output so apparent effort equals actual effort 🤮

c) Parlay elegance from hindsight simplification of original work into BONUS output 😎

A bonus is low-marginal-effort/high-marginal-value unexpected extra output that cashes out discovered elegance in a solution to a problem via speculative scope expansion.

You basically create & pick low-hanging fruit people didn’t think was within reach, and weren’t aiming for

It is exceeding expectations but not to demonstrate a superhuman work ethic. Instead it is exceeding expectations as a consequence of unexpected discovery. You’re saying, “this turned out to be more delightfully elegant than we thought when scoping, here’s a cherry on top!”

Your own expectations of effort/reward ratio were pleasantly violated and you’re capturing and passing on some of the excess reward. As a result, total apparent effort equals total actual effort but everybody gets more value than they expected, with no dumb obfuscation.

For this to happen, a bonus needs to feel like a good gift. Something that expands minds by showcasing the abundance you’ve stumbled across. It should address a subconscious want that’s outside the plan, rather than a conscious need that’s within it. Not 20% more; 20% different.

The thing about discovered elegance (ie potential for hindsight simplification in the output of complex effort) is that it’s not necessarily “efficiency” in the sense of achieving a goal with less resources, gaining “savings”. You’ve already sunk inelegant effort. So what to do?

If you’re on an iterative learning curve, maybe future instances of effort can be cheaper. For example, in doing a manual analysis, you spot an elegant algorithm for automating it that makes future instances much cheaper and faster. That’s close-ended learning. Lean learning.

But discovered elegance is rarely that limited. Nature rarely hands you “lean” gifts that can only be used to make the next instance cheaper. Nature is not a “25% off  next purchase” coupon gifter. Nature’s gifts have unexpected “fat” spillover potential, like a cashback.

But to actually claim the gift, you have to open up the scope of what you’re doing. You have a hammer in your hand you didn’t expect to have. You must look around for nails you didn’t know were hammerable. If you don’t, and only look within existing scope, you will likely *lose*.

The hammer in this metaphor can be thought of as discovered IP. Depending on the nature of the work context, you may have some claim on the IP itself (for example my former employer Xerox had a mechanism to assign IP it had no use for back to inventor employees).

If for example, you invent a better mousetrap while employed at Mousetraps, Inc. you may lose some pay for sunk effort (it looks like a day’s work, actually took a week) but get a patent bonus, and maybe rights for non-mousetrapping applications. But these are side issues.

The deeper point here is developing a bonus/spillover ‘lucky’ mentality and actively looking for elegance in everything you do. Even at the risk of lower immediate reward due to maker’s dilemma. In the short run, in specific gigs, you may lose rewards.

But in the long run, you’ll develop a reputation for being unreasonably lucky and inspired. A “done, and gets things smart” genius rather than a mere “smart, and gets things done” worker-bee. See Steve Yegge post on this: http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html

A bonus mentality is also the trick behind “talent hits what others can’t hit, genius hits what others can’t see”, can you guess why?

It has to do with “obviousness” in where you’ve come from versus in where you could go.

If an “obvious” insight at line 800/week 3 of coding V1 of a program leads you to actually deliver a 20-line V2 that takes 1 hour to write, your client will feel cheated if you charge more than a day. 

But the 3 weeks are not waste, they’ve refactored your perception!

The client is the beneficiary of a more cheaply hammered nail, but you’re the one with the new hammer, capable of seeing the nails others can’t see. They will... after you point them out, and hammer a few bonus nails to teach them.

Those bonus nails are how you capture more value from your insights AND ensure everybody groks the potential so it’s turned into spillover societal value.

That is the big prize. So don’t let the maker’s dilemma in creative work inhibit your openness to discovery. 

Carpe diem!

## 15. On Mysteries

*November 29, 2018*

A thread about mysteries.

A mystery is a clear pattern that points *dramatically* to the existence of an unexplained coherent phenomenon, preventing you from ignoring it, but without immediately elucidating it by *also* pointing to some obvious possible explanations.

A minimum level of drama is necessary otherwise it’s too easy to ignore. The more personal the mystery, the lower the drama needed for it to be perceived as such. Mystery noise in your car = mystery illness next door = murder in next town = serial killer in neighboring country

In a non-mystery, obvious explanations will seem individually sufficient and collectively necessary: ISCN. Holmes’ law (when you’ve eliminated impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true) is the related belief that there is *always* a non-mysterious explanation

Alternately, Holmes’ law is the idea that there are no “real” mysteries. All mysteries are apparent. The explanation will seem obvious in hindsight. Or in other words, will elucidate the apparent mystery within your current world view, requiring no expansion OR contraction of it.

So a real, non-Holmesian (like non-Euclidean) mystery is one whose elucidation will require you to expand or contract your world view.  If it recurs, or consequences (usually bad, sometimes good) accumulate, it’s a active mystery. Else, a cold mystery.

A mystery is *potential* ontological debt OR credit that you hope will turn out in hindsight to be mere epistemological debt: an apparent mystery. Ie that you can explain it eventually in terms of things you already know, without introducing new entities or eliminating old ones.

Take a weird recurring god-shaped stain on a wall. Atheists hope it can be explained without requiring formation of a new belief in god. Literalist theists hope god won’t be possible to eliminate as a suspect (taking him a step closer to full unemployment, their greatest fear)

The thing is, the anticipation of ontological expansion OR contraction is anxiety-provoking even if the material effects of the existence of the mystery are good. Why? Because the presence of a mystery says something about the future computational burden of life itself.

Expansion is easier. Adding a new ontological primitive (‘Thing’) to a world view makes all future thinking harder. It is open-ended future computation cost. Contraction is subtler: you now have to go through and refactor your entire world view to see if Thing can be eliminated.

Contraction though is a bounded short term cost with long-term benefit. You only have to audit existing beliefs for the continued necessity of Thing that has lost an important explanatory contest. Its adaptive fitness in your head has been lowered.

Why? Because a world view should be the fewest possible Things all doing comparable amounts of explanatory “work” in your world view. You don’t want epistemological slackers or free loaders in your ontology. Things that elucidate fewer phenomena are computationally costlier.

If most Things help elucidate 1000 non-mysteries, the one Thing that helps elucidate only 3 things is an ontological dog, the opposite of a god, who elucidates way too many things. You don’t want dogs in your ontology.  You want to fire them if possible.

Less obviously, you also want to fire gods: Things in your ontology that do way too much work, but don’t do them very well. Like only accounting for things in hindsight, never with foresight. Or worse, just naming them. Both gods and dogs are bad head employees. Deadwood.

A mystery is an opportunity to do some ontological creative destruction in your head. Eliminate a dog that isn’t pulling its weight epistemologically, or a god that’s half-assing too many things.

Whether a Thing in your head is a god or a dog is actually a relative rather than an absolute condition. A god explains more than other Things, a dog explains less. Gods weaken into either average Things, or turn into dogs and are at risk of being fired. Darwin in your head.

“Compression” can be viewed as eliminating both dogs and gods from your ontology so you have the fewest possible, equally hard-working ontological primitives in your head. Euclid’s fifth postulate was fired for doing too little. As were aether and phlogiston and other goddogs.

In general, try to solve mysteries with Holmes’ law. Start with the obvious (abduction), eliminate the impossible (deduction), make less obvious things more obvious (discovery/investigation), repeat till you’re down to 1 explanation. Confirm with further tests (induction)

But there should be no *mysterious* loose ends. Lestrade and Japp always make the same mistake which Holmes and Poirot don’t: dismiss seemingly trivial loose ends. Holmes and Poirot have a lower threshold for mystification. They won’t accept implausible accounts even for trivia.

They know that Holmes’ law and ISCN only apply in a closed set. Eliminating the impossible in an open set with explanandum “leaks” doesn’t get you certainty. Just makes you inclined to feed confirmation bias by ignoring “coincidences” or implausibly explaining away “trivialities“

Mysteries don’t care about importance. Small mysteries have to be explained as plausibly as big mysteries. Reasonable doubt creeps in as surely through an unimportant implausibility as an important one. *Entire world views are only as plausible as their least plausible argument.*

But occasionally, this approach will stall and you’ll be faced with a genuine rather than apparent mystery. You’ll need to follow Dirk Gently’s law: don’t eliminate the impossible. Ie entertain the possibility of needing to adding/eliminating primitives.

Removing god from “mystery of wall stain” is trivial. Removing god from “creation of life” is not. 

Adding is never trivial. You can’t add just a local ghost to explain a case. You must add ‘ghost’ as a base class to universe (you have inescapable existence proof).

Removing a dog — ontological primitive that has very few explanations it is needed in — is something like extinction. Beyond a point, it is doomed as a breeding, self-perpetuating, employed Thing, and any loss of an explanatory contest “job” might be the last.

Anyhow, that’s it for my elucidation of the mystery of mysteries. Stay mentally healthy and computationally robust by constantly solving both Holmesian apparent, or epistemological, mysteries and Gentlyian ontological ones. Head Darwinism ftw.

## 16. Agency in the Developing World

*November 30, 2018*

Income/wealth inequality is not a good proxy for agency inequality. Many developing countries have high $ inequality but admirably egalitarian levels of suckagency. The system is a robust nexus of homeostatic suckage in which nobody has significantly higher suckagency than others

Lemme elaborate on what I was getting at in this tweet and also complicate your thinking about robots and AIs and NPCs and botfood trashmobs and UBI along the way. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1068298230998347777?s=20

Weak infrastructure means nominally powerful (wealthy, warlordy, politicians) can *do* less.  Warlords have AK-47s, hobby drones but not Predator drones or an NSA. The wealthy can party or get surgery in Switzerland on numbered account $ but only enjoy limited lifestyles at home.

The state is large but ineffective so there’s a limit to what you can do with political power. High-level corruption is easy, but a smoothly running and legal crony capitalist extract/exploit/oppress machine needs developed country infrastructure, modulo curse of resources.

An old R. K. Laxman cartoon from socialist-era India captures this. A poor farmer is remarking to a politician touring a storm-hit village: “Oh the cyclone did crores* worth of damage to our village? Great! I didn’t think our village had more than Rs. 50!”

* 1 crore =10 million

In developing world, you feel tossed about by fate, but it’s a natural sort of fate that afflicts the powerful almost as much. In the developed world, infrastructure represents a pie of real beyond-nature agency to master fate with, but a few dominate it. The rest feel hapless.

Frustrations of striving haplessly for a better life differ. Here it can feel like everything is rigged against you by a few. Bankers, CEOs and whatnot dungeon-master small gods. There, striving can feel like trying to violate laws of physics. Favor of small gods is little help.

Net result is paradox of the median psyche. The median developing world person has less absolute control over their life, but takes more charge of it. Even emo poets hustle more. The median developed world person has more absolute control but acts more helpless and hapless.

There is more of a sense of being a pawn/npc in consequential games of powerful, which are easier to simply tolerate as a low-impact annoyance tax in developing world. Basic tradeoff is higher basic standard of living, but lower *relative* agency over life terms and conditions.

It’s not that developing world people are made of sterner stuff. It’s just that the weak simply... die. You can’t drag on lives of debt traps, major illness, social isolation, indefinitely like you can in developed world. The suckage continuously culls the weak, deservedly or not

Or to put it another way, it would be much harder for a class of true hikkikomori to emerge in developing world. There simply isn’t enough fat in the infrastructure to carry them for very long, or maintain them in psychological quasi-stability with video games.

It’s like developed world countries make you click a huge TOS “I agree” button on a bigger social contract the instant you’re born. Lots of comfort and convenience lie beyond the button, but you sign away more relative agency. Like take life/death power credit scores have in US.

Developing world, the social contract covers so little, you cannot sign away a lot even if you want to. Your air conditioner and fridge can’t spy on you if there’s no electricity half the time. Where there is no water supply to begin with, a Flint-like situation is moot.

The reason of course is that for a few decades the developed world was constructing mindless wealth-making machines out of human-NPCs. The lowest strata of humans were more valuable alive-but-haplessly-consuming-on-credit than dead.

"The universe is an animal, it grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them...You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top and take reality for a ride but it'll never stop trying to throw you. And eventually it will, there's no other way off" - Rick

Things are changing of course, and very fast. Developing world governments/elites are figuring out how to gain western level control over populations without providing western level Comfort and Convenience in return. Cheaper hunger games fodder.

There is a weird political leapfrogging here. Developed world had to actually develop to allow median citizen to enter “I shall be obedient pawn” TOS with elite Small Gods of Universe. The developing world is skipping that. NPC-pawnification via smartphones without development!

You can see the effects among developed world elites: the bottom layers of learned helplessness they created have turned into liabilities. Conservatism has evolved into a “why don’t you just die?” kind of anger towards them. They are genuinely envious of developing country elites

Developing country elites can now get masses of NPC pawns in return for promising 1/100th the rewards. Developing world NPCs to populate Straussian Games can be had for pennies on the dollar. Ad-clicking zombies? Pennies in the dollar. Fox-waching zombies? Pennies on the dollar.

This is the backdrop against which AI/robot stuff must be considered. Human-NPCs being replaced were promised a certain TOS lifestyle at a certain agency-price. There’s new work they could do, but manufactured haplessness/sense of TOS-betrayal makes them mostly capable of anger.

Apply working:dependent population logic to them. Working population  + technology will now need to support retirees, children... and angry/hapless no-longer-needed NPCs whose best-case life outcome now is safety-net+family-dependency+hikkikomori pleasures.

This logic puts a new interpretation on idea of UBI. It is best viewed as a “free future hikkikomori before they get so mad they burn everything down” move. Renegotiate the basic social contract to be more like the developing world. You get less, but in a form you control more.

This overall convergent pattern of evolution in developed and developing world points to a particular kind of human condition. Elites cheaply controlling masses of human NPCs, robots, and AIs, offering much less material plenty than before (airline amenities anyone?) in return.

This is important: BOTH developed and developing worlds are converging to a new asymptote. It’s a mistake to think that either 1st world is going 3rd world or 3rd world is going 1st. Both are going 2nd world (now we finally know what 2nd world actually is: software-eaten world!)

You can either join this budget airline of a civilizational path, or make the reverse tradeoff of industrial modernity: more agency, less stuff. Climate action pressures will simply add gradually increasing stress in this direction.

## 17. On Being Forgotten

*December 3, 2018*

Just had an epiphany thanks to a comment of @krrishd on another thread. The sense of being "forgotten" by a grand narrative is actually a sense of being remembered culturally, but being forgotten institutionally.

A sense of one's honor being paid lip service, and being acknowledged as somehow "superior" or "better" than others, but not being given any substantive rewards in proportion via institutional means.

This is the sentiment behind "when you're used to privilege, equality feels like oppression". The privilege there is *real* privilege, like poor whites being maintained at just a notch of actual material plenty by institutional means than poor blacks (eg. not being redlined)

I think this has a specific historical source: Jacksonian clientelism. A system of spoils-based patronage doled out at the level of groups. The American populace was trained to a) vote in ethnic blocs b) expect rewards in ethnic blocs in the form of institutional spoils

Today's spoils system, even in the aggressively non-merit-based system Trump is practicing at the level of political appointments, is a weak shadow of the system that existed between the 1830s and ~ 1920s, when the increasing role of professionalization and merit diminished it

Broadly understood, "spoils" is a much wider concept, going back to idea of "spoils of war" (victorious armies given  legal right to loot conquered peoples). This is the origin of the *legitimation* of expropriation (public -> private) and outright loot (private -> private)

The American spoils system is vast, deep, and society-scale, but it is a weak shadow of its past now. Comparable things in the developing world are simply called "corruption" or "nepotism". They are definitely not legitimized by design as here.

Now what does this have to do with being forgotten? To be "forgotten" in a political sense has a very specific meaning: to be on the "winning" team, but *denied a share of the institutional spoils.*

Ironically, you could consider this Reagan's great egalitarian legacy: through deregulation, he kinda dismantled the spoils system. There was no such thing as "dibs" and first right of looting. But he retained the culture of expropriation/looting-based public-private relations.

Though those with a historic accumulated advantage still had a head start, they didn't have an institutionally sanctioned looting advantage. Now looting itself became a meritocratic game. Neoliberalism in a hostile nutshell: meritocratic looting of public resources.

This meant legacy wealth and relationships/social networks might confer an advantage if you were a real hustler, but the doors of opportunity had been opened a crack to everybody. And merely having a certain tribal affiliation was no longer guarantee of first shot at anything.

Everywhere in the world neoliberalism went with its set of new rules, the same thing happened: institutionally sanctioned asymmetries in looting privileges were replaced with a free-for-all model, and suddenly, affirmative action for cultural majorities everywhere vanished.

This is important. Pre-neoliberalism, there was a pretense of "impersonal" institutions, but they weren't really. They systematically advantaged the local cultural majority in subtle/not-so-subtle ways. That's the real affirmative action, except we never called it that.

What we instead called "affirmative action" was efforts to take nominal "impersonal" institutional missions seriously and release them from de facto clientelistic capture by cultural majorities. But even best efforts of the left could't match how well neoliberalism achieved it.

The thing is, neoliberalism recognized that the real thing to make impersonal was the foundational looting structure of clientelistic politics (invented in the US in the 1830s, now the global standard, see Fukuyama, Political Order and Political Decay).

By contrast, the LBJ great society model (and similar things worldwide) made the mistake of trying to make the aspirational, de jure, positive mission of institutions more impersonal/equal, rather than the de facto expropriation/looting mission.

Here's another way to think of it: "spoils" come from war. And war is basically at least half the institutional landscape, and every institution has a "peace" (aspirational, de jure, welfare mission) and "war" (expropriational, de facto, looting mission) side to it.

There is no point trying to make the peace side more truly impersonal if you leave the war side alone. There is no point in university admissions affirmative action if you don't equalize the "spoils of degrees" post-graduation ecosystem. Neoliberalism managed it.

We are now seeing the effects of that. Around the world, the global ethnonationalist wave is a result of 20-30 years of dismantlement of institutional affirmative action for local cultural majorities by the democratized looting/expropriation regime of neoliberalism.

Yes, it helps to be a cis-white-male to play in the game in the US (and a brahmin male in India and Han in China and Kikuyu in Kenya or whatever), but mainly you have to be willing and skilled enough to play in the Hobbesian meritocratic game of expropriation/privatization.

And predictably, the great worldwide Hobbesian A/B test delivered exactly the result us cynics would expect: people of all races/types are equally good at rising to the top of such games. Just look at the rogues gallery of high-level billion-dollar scammers around the world.

The losers everywhere have been the *protected* mediocrities with cultural-majority affiliations everywhere, who had gotten complacent in their sense of institutionally validated (and undeservedly rewarded) sense of being "better" as a member of a "state-chosen" people.

So the idea that "when you're used to privilege, equality feels like oppression", read it as "institutionally advantaged looting/spoils privileges", not lip-service narrative spotlight. For "equality" read "equality of looting/expropriation opportunity" not institutional access.

If you think about it, in a grand narrative sense, the pissed off seething-ressentiment ethnomajoritarian masses were never forgotten. They had continuous claim on being "real" Americans. It just got hollowed out, with real rewards being deregulated for democratic looting.

This ~40 year trajectory is why I'm ultimately not worried about the "SJW" bogeyperson (heh!) threat. They're merely trying to recode old, shrinking spoils system in their favor. What good is control of universities or academic publishing if action has left the building?

Public funding for "impersonal" institutions everywhere is shrinking, and being replaced with equivalent neoliberal equal-opportunity expropriation institution. SJWs are fighting over shrinking old pie. Ethnonationalists are mad about not getting first slice of growing new pie.

SJWs are fighting over the dead carcass of the old world. The amount of damage they can do is fundamentally limited. The ethnonationalist right though, is threatening the living, growing thing. The amount of damage they can do is basically infinite. They might kill golden goose.

Can we do better than neoliberalism? Yeah, sure, We can and we must, since big new challenges like climate change seem out of reach for its institutions (it is *powered* by tragedy of the commons in the worst case). More critically, it is based on nation states.

I for one would like to eat my cake (impersonal, democratic opportunity spaces) and have it too (spaces that are based on expanding knowledge rather than Hobbesian looting). Unclear how to get there, but that's what I want.

## 18. External vs. Internal Locus of Control

*December 9, 2018*

There are 2 kinds of people: external versus internal locus of control (ELoC vs ILoC), based on how they tend to explain events, and whether they favor attributing external or internal factors. You can tell them apart by heat signatures of their responses to things going wrong.

I think the traditional theory of LoC is incomplete. It tempts you to conclude that  ELoCs feel “helpless”and therefore act less energetically when things go wrong. No, in fact they act MORE energetically than ILoCs, who respond with restrained energy. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control

Yes, ELoCs think events can be explained by factors outside their control, but no they don’t react with helpless resignation. They typically ACT to either bring those factors into their control, or more commonly, try to forcefully influence those they see as having the control.

ELoCs run hot. When things go wrong, they tend to react with high-energy patterns targeting outside world, often angry/violent ones. 

ILoCs run cold. When things go wrong they turn inward into deeper introspection low-energy patterns until they are barely alive. 

I’m ILoC obv.

This is NOT extrovert/introvert. Both can be either ELoC or ILoC.  Example, in Myers-Briggs terms, INTJs tend to be ELoC, but INTPs tend to be ILoC. It’s where you explain things (inside or outside) not where you “live”. 

But misaligned E’s or I’s create extreme temperaments.

Speculative 2x2

ILoC+introvert =  Chronic Depressive/bipolar
ELoC+introvert = Hikkikomori/cold-revenge server
ILoC+extrovert = Drama Queen
ELoC+extrovert = Chaosmaker

ILoCs are well-understood because they tend to self-document exits from bad (low-energy) states in autobiographical writing. ELoCs help by supplying high-energy stimuli like dragging ILoC friends out of shells. People who like “introvert” memes are often actually ILoC extroverts.

Enough about ILoCs. We talk way too much about them. Let’s talk ELoCs.

ELoCs are often seen as “problem people” in bad situations because their “bad-state” responses are high-energy. You can ignore a low-energy ILoC fuck-up but an ELoC fuck-up demands management from others.

This should be obvious from the definition. If someone tends to blame external factors and people for their suffering, there’s a good chance they’ll turn into problems for those blamed factors. ELoCs spread their pain around to make their problem everybody’s problem.

To the extent a problem is shared by a group, ILoCs tend to exit shared problems if nobody cares to “save” them. ELoCs otoh, if unmanaged by others, tend to become part of the problem, and further down the death spiral, bigger than the original shared problem.

When Churchill said “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself” he was thinking ELoCs. People who add energy to a problem whether or not they also add commensurate intelligence to help resolve it. Energy without intelligence is explosive energy.

ELoCs — External-locus-of-control people — are exhausting to be around. When down, they keep punching down harder and harder in a mean-spirited way, getting madder and madder. Only thing I know of that flips them to ‘nice’ is lining up a small skill-based win for them...

But then they turn around, get all holier-than-thou, and get madder and madder punching UP in a mean-spirited way. Lining up a small dose of luck turns them ‘nice’ again.

Keeping anELoC in a healthy band of generous-spirited motivation is hard.

You have to feed them a steady stream of correctly calibrated “luck” and “merit-based wins” to stabilize. Since they NEVER turn inward to explain anything, only external stimuli work. I suspect cognitive-behavioral therapy fails on such people.  They need pure behaviorism.

Or to put it another way, cognitive reframing etc are weak behavior change levers if there are very few frames to begin with, and they’re all mostly unconscious firmware. Their conscious frames are about modeling external factors. Mostly external “people” factors. Blame frames.

Don’t get me wrong. ELoCs are an important part of healthy societal problem solving. They bring all the energy and the focus on external factors needed if indeed that’s the locus of the problem. They are the ‘unreasonable’ people all change depends on.

But when they “break bad”,  especially on wicked problems with big internal AND external contributing factors, ELoCs, who are probably the majority, can turn cancerous. They bring change energy to the party with no good ideas. Result: things go BOOM! 

Societal meltdowns.

Introverted ELoCs are particularly dangerous since they can seethe in resentment for years, accumulating energy, until they finally blow up. Often described as a “silent majority.” Probably better described as “ticking time bombs.”

If you are ILoC and have ELoCs in your life you will learn to manage them with merit-win+luck game-making, and they’ll swing between hating/thanking you for it. That’s your cross to bear. They’ll return favor by pumping you up when you’re low-energy. That’s their cross to bear.

But at macro scale things are much harder. ILoCs never cause collective level problems because they retreat, self-isolate. But ELoCs can connect, feed off each other and turn into explosive metastasized societal problems. True believer mobs etc. ILoCs can’t easily “manage” this.

An ILoC at the end of his rope is likely to commit suicide. If the cause is external, ultimate failure mode of looking internal is to run out of life energy in isolation.

ELoCs too, commit suicide at the end of their rope, but like to take as many people with them as possible.

This is the fundamental asymmetry of LoC sociology. During general bad times, full of both internal and external factors driving multiple wicked problems, you get both a suicide epidemic AND an epidemic of suicide-bombing type events. The latter is the bigger problem.

In fact a great deal of societal/institutional design is devoted to ELoC management: making sure ELoC introverts have safe outlets so they don’t accumulate “Cold Revenge” energy, and ELoC extroverts have zones to act where chaosmaking is an asset, like entrepreneurship.

Institutional failure is almost always ELoC containment failure.  ELoC introverts connecting and blowing up. ELoC extroverts turning to crime or cult leadership (there’s a Baumol paper about the latter). 

We’re in a condition of near ELoC meltdown right now.

I don’t have answers here yet, but I think this is the question next-gen institutional design (my current big interest) has to answer: How do we control and manage ELoC energy so it powers society steadily instead of blowing it up every decade.

Baumol paper I mentioned: “Entrepreneurship: Productive, Unproductive, and Destructive”

## 19. The only liberal move is not to play

*December 17, 2018*

I’ve been wondering why there are no “own the illibs” memes. Then it hit me: the main way any sort of liberal (big tent sense, including progressive and classical) “owns” illiberalism is simply not participating in it. Not “getting with the program.” Going idle if necessary.

It’s like saying “I’ll take the next one” when you don’t want to get on an elevator with some bunch of people. It is insulting to the degree there is room in the elevator. The biggest “own the illibs” move is simply not getting on the illiberal train. No matter how much they win.

The simplest and most powerful “weapon of the weak” is non-participation. It does more than rob the illiberal movement of energy and labor. It undermines it. That’s why they are desperate to “own” you in a rhetorical judo sense because they can’t actually own an unconsenting mind

The thing is, illiberal movements tend to be totalizing. There’s a promised land, everybody can and must go there, it will last forever, no need to go anywhere else after. To say “I’ll take the next one” is to belie the posture that this is the only one and the last one.

Even ethnonationalism has a promised land all must go to. It’s called Back Home. Because the promised land is a planet where there’s a natural “ancestral” place for everyone and everybody is in their place. At least genocide isn’t plan A, so it’s marginally better than fascism.

To the ones on elevator, it’s a threat because to them it’s not just one in an unending up-down circuit. It’s more like last boarding call on last ark of survival. To refuse to get on is to say “I don’t think there will be a flood”.  Makes it hard/impossible for them to pretend

Non-participation is so powerful it even works on *other* weapons of the weak, like strikes, boycotts, rioting. You may need to be stealthy about it, even lie, but it’s the most basic move. The zero of the political action number line. Labor can be forced, belief cannot.

But non-participation can only be used as a weapon to undermine totalizing ideologies, against which it is all-powerful. But there is a class of ideologies against which it is entirely ineffective: pluralistic ideologies.

A pluralist ideology is the opposite of totalitarian. If your ideology doesn’t require 100% local monopoly and can live with competitors so long as it has space and social energy for itself, non-participation is neither an insult nor a threat. It’s not an imperative to “own” you.

Communism failed precisely because capitalism is best defined primarily as non-participation in communism. It’s the scabspace. The ultimate scabs are not workers who break a picketting action, but consumers who don’t stop consuming out of solidarity with *particular* producers.

The punchiest “own the libs” illiberal meme, NPC, almost tags their actual biggest threat: true non-players of the illiberal game. Not the ones who indulge in futile resistance posturing but the ones who simply don’t opt-in to the illiberalism du jour. “I’ll take the next one.”

Non-participation is a tactic, not an ideology. Its meanings are context-dependent. When they want you to do X, you avoid it, make excuses, fake it, sandbag, drag feet, take a knee, reject job offers from presidents. When they want you to stop doing X, you continue stealthily.

Note: a lot of non-participation tactics are identified with labor movement, but that’s *coordinated, collective non-participation.*

The underlying tactic is available to all individuals at all times, so is pre-ideological. Like Bartleby’s “I’d prefer not to,” but with a plan B.

Totalizing, illiberal ideologies feed on growth and expansionary takeover of minds. They burn it all up and then they burn out. Because unlike pluralist ideologies (which are liberal by construction) they have no sustainable internal energy source.

They *have* to operate like MLM/ponzi schemes. Without new recruits there is only natural attrition and flame out.  Then the next elevator comes along. And the next. And you can say, “I’ll take the next one” each time. Because here’s the thing: *you don’t have to take one at all*

I once read a quote (in Keller Easterling’s book Extrastatecraft, but can’t recall attribution) that “liberalism is not the sort of thing that has an essence.” Kinda. The essence of liberalism is non-participation optionality. Saying no. Waiting. To “take the next one” or stairs.

Because pluralism (and all liberalism is pluralist) is fundamentally the belief that ideology is not in fact necessary for life. Life can go on, and sustainable energy for the psyche found, without going into the fold of a True Believer sheeple. Life without ideology is possible.

As a result pluralist ideologies exclusively rely on opt-in temptations and reject the totalizing impulse. If they can’t get to self-sustaining critical mass, they adapt and evolve rather than turn to coercion. Minimum viable size for a pluralist ideology might be just 1 person.

Hell it can be less than 1 person. I’m capitalist on MWF, socialist on TuThu, traditionalist on Saturday, and ungoverned anarchist on Sunday. If I were more imaginative I’d have DIY substitutes for all 4. And they’d be all sub-singleton.

Note that mere multiplicity of belief options and co-existence is not enough. It is necessary but not sufficient. What makes it pluralist and liberal is the opt-in factor, with no punitive consequences for opt-out. So intersectionality is neither liberal, nor pluralist.

It is in fact isomorphic to right ethnonationalism. A place for everyone and everyone in their place. It’s just that promised land is not the static ancestral political geography of earth but a Standard Database Schema maintained by First Bureaucrats instead of First Ancestors.

This is why illiberal criticisms of free markets from both left and right sound silly *in the same way*. They look for a totalizing coordination nerve center like their own to attack but cant find one. Tilting at “bankers” or “1%” is ultimately as futile as 9/11 was for Al Qaeda.

Free markets are primarily free in a pluralist competition sense. All distortions coming from illiberalisms. And not only is totalizing presence NOT a goal for any one player, it is both ideologically rejected as bad (monopoly) and constraints generally accepted, even welcomed.

Sure pluralism of any form, in a market form or some other structural form, has a critical flaw: tragedy of the commons. But here’s the thing: no totalizing ideology to date has been a better steward of any commons. They just sacralize it in words while defiling it in the dark.

So: the most liberal thing you can do, for as long as it takes, is to simply find a way to keep existing and say “I’ll take the next one” no matter what the provocation, goading, mocking, or seduction. That’s the only own-the-illibs move you need. They’re on a clock. You’re not.

## 20. Crackpot Metaphysics

*December 18, 2018*

Crackpot metaphysics math/geometry alert. 

This thread is likely only of interest to people who follow the backstage threads of my thinking/writing based on my moderately insane inside-baseball pseudomath constructs.

Headline: Breakthrough on backstage scaffolding problem for my thinking that’s been bugging me since 2016: a poiesis-to-praxis spectrum measure for “work”!

P=N/D = (average social distance from which thing will be judged)/(average arbitrariness with which a thing will be judged)

N = 0 for self, ∞ for stranger. 
D = 0 for “there is no wrong way” solipsism, ∞ for inscrutable Martian judge (and very high for mysterious, partly algorithmic virality standards)

For “normal” standards, D will be finite and >0, so P= 0 for pure poiesis, ∞ for pure praxis.

Think “poem that only makes sense to you” for pure poiesis, “Martian tax return” for pure praxis.

P is actually a vector (P, θ ) with origin at “void” in my goat-crow-rat triangle visualization, with magnitude P and direction θ being interpreted by the triangle semantics. See my 2 posts from 2017 for background.

https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/27/been-there-done-that/

https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/06/06/thingness-and-thereness/

See also my “make your own rules” post from this year to see how I work with this construct in an applied way. Yes, it’s a very inside-my-own-head piece of INTP/J nerdery but I think it’s not too opaque if you’ve relatively close to my headspace https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/02/15/make-your-own-rules/

The original trailhead for this bunnytrail btw was Hannah Arendt “The Human Condition” book which was a key read for 2016. Here are some slides with my notes:

https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/12/21/the-computational-condition/

... and a post with my gloss on her model of vita activa
https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/09/14/how-to-make-history/

In relation to the GCR triangle, my formula for P nicely maps to 0 for the void at triangle centroid and ∞ for arbitrarily high potential complexity of situating your work in the universe. The boundary represented by the triangle maps to a threshold value of P. Call it P*.

P* is basically where praxis > poiesis in a context-dependent sense. It maps to a neuroscience boundary between DMN (default mode network) headspace and TPN (task-positive network) headspace.  It’s the boundary of practicality.

P*(θ) is a nonlinear, piecewise continuous function with 3 regimes corresponding to the edges, and 3 discontinuities, corresponding to the vertices. Think of these edges as 3 tires where rubber meets road.

My bold claim: *any thought you think can be plotted on the triangle.* It lives at coordinates (P, θ). A thought trail over time can be captured as a curve parametrized by time, (P(t), θ(t)). But thoughts —> triangle is many-to-one. Closer to the center, less unique the thoughts.

Mindfuck extension: t itself is a function of P and θ! Because time warps from chronos —> kairos —> aionic as you retreat into your own head. Time stops at pure poiesis. Singularity past your own event horizon as you retreat inside your head 😎😇

So it’s really a manifold of thinkable thoughts in 3d space (P, θ,t). I haven’t yet worked out how to precisely model the time part. It may not be worth elaborating since I can’t think of a clean empirical interpretation, only a metaphysical one.

There’s also the super-crackpot idea that P*(θ,t) is actually a Penrose triangle in some projections, modeling core “break” in psyche of any live person. It looks connected but paradoxical from some angles but if you change POV, break causing the illusion will be visible.

I’ll probably dump this Penrose triangle thing in future versions. It’s just a little too crackpot and bolted-on even for me. It does arise naturally from the phenomenology, but fits awkwardly with the rest of the mode

Fun fact #1: the triangular construct can itself be plotted inside the triangle. I think it is close to the center, somewhere along the blue edge.

Fun fact #2: this thread itself can be mapped to the triangle. It wanders in and out past the green edge, getting deeper in for more crackpot tweets, further out for points that make sense from external frames of reference.

Fun fact #3, the “breakthrough” idea here (for a poiesis-praxis parameter) is a neat leap into the triangle across the red edge.

For all you mysticism nerds, “enlightenment” is obviously at the exact center where time stops (pure aion), marked by thoughts like “that thou art” or “the rock has Buddha nature” just next to it.  The exact center = non-thought.

A logical thought curve will be continuous. An intuitive one will jump around. An “Aha!” will be a big discontinuous jump inward (more poiesis). An “UnAha!” (falsification) will be a big discontinuous jump outward. Here’s an old post on UnAha! experiences: https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/03/05/unaha/

A theory-to-practice thought trail will be an arrow heading out. An example-to-generalization will head the other way. Triangle contours = consistent time perception. Going mad is a terminal inward spiral. Rejoining humanity from the depths of madness is an outward spiral.

Anyhow, there you go. I may write this all up as a post, but if not this thread is it. 

This might interest @fortelabs

## 21. Judge them by their topics

*December 18, 2018*

You know that line about judging people by their actions rather than their words? What about people whose only non-trivial output is words? (assume their actions are boringly uncontroversial, like say living basic middle class life funded by job at paper factory)

Here’s a way.

Judge them by topics rather than  methods of thought. The thinker’s equivalent of action is choice of topic. Almost always, all the real risk is there (but CRUCIALLY may not be borne by the thinker). Methodology (analytical, empirical, logical, narrative, metaphoric) is secondary

There is a particular kind of motte and bailey maneuver where criticism of the risky part (topic/content) is redirected to an innocent-faced defense of the safe part (method). *Especially when the risk of any erroneous conclusions on the topic is borne by others.*

“I’m just asking questions”, “I’m doing this with normal rigor”, “I’m just following the evidence where it leads” are telltale signs. The part that needs discussion is choice of topic/content. Methods come after. The riskier the topic, the more safety/competence methodology needs

If you study “how stars go supernova” the only justification needed is “I’m curious about it.”

If you, as a male, study “are there gender differences in IQ?” in a world circumstantially loaded with male advantage, the burden of philosophical due diligence is higher. Why and how?

The reason is, *if you screw up and others use your results, others will be hurt far more than you.* Worse, there is prima facie reason to believe sloppiness and errors will likely benefit men. Primum non nocere. First do no harm.

Ask: “Who suffers most if I screw this up?”

You’ve heard “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” Corollary “extraordinary risk to others from thinking errors requires extraordinary care in how you think.” 

Beware the moral hazards of your topic choices.

This isn’t hard. You take more precautions when experimenting with explosives than when experimenting with cookie recipes. You triple check every decision and step if you’re researching “should we bomb this country” but not for “should we hold the event in NY or LA.”

Add another wrinkle. Call it the Incumbency Bias of Social Research Under Sloppiness.

Other things being equal, sloppiness in research about humans is more likely to suffer errors that lead to conclusions that hurt the weak/validate the position of strong. Sewage flows downhill.

Consider a caricature: 2 bad-faith researchers researching “racial bias in police shootings” with intent to find yes and no answers respectively by any means necessary. Are they really equally risky? When should we demand deeper rigor?

There is a theory in complex systems called “normal accidents” about how complex systems like nuclear reactors inevitably (Ie “normally”) suffer failures via multiple failures interacting in unanticipated ways. This means some things are fundamentally more risky.

The author, Charles Perrow, in fact takes the conservative view that sufficiently complex tech like nuclear reactors with sufficiently high negative failure costs should not be used at all. I’m not that radical, but he has a point. And the point applies to “complex thinking” too

If you’re thinking about sufficiently complex topics full of tricky interactions (“Oh Roe vs. Wade led to crime wave ending 20y later...oh wait no, it was taking the lead out of pipes!”) *you WILL make unexpected normal errors*

You may moreover be thinking under deep moral hazard of being nowhere near the  reactor meltdown zones. In social research this might be: policing, criminal justice, public schooling, nutrition, education, war-making. Entire communities could be deeply screwed by your errors.

And this shouldn’t need saying but apparently does. The more powerful you are, the more extreme care you need to take because your casual speculative tweeting could cascade into ill-considered action a few degrees away. Think longer per tweet the more powerful you are.

I’m a random D-list blogger. If I tweet speculative dumb shit, very little happens, but there’s more potential for damage than with someone with no following. If you’re a famous academic who has the ear of impulsive CEOs more can happen. If you’re president, wars might start.

If you transpose Perrow’s conclusions about nuclear reactors to social science, you would in fact conclude that some subjects should not be studied at all.

Because the only people with the methodological competence to study it might be under unacceptably high moral hazard.

This is why I’m fundamentally sympathetic to even (say) the most irrational sounding black activists who might want to object to (say) white men studying IQ. The researchers are safe in their nice university jobs. Any errors leading to social policy meltdowns, guess who suffers?

There are two ways to bring these nuclear reactor “normal accident” topics into “safe study” zone. 

First: add more methodological rigor burdens in proportion to risk to others. IRB++. But this won’t be enough to bring more responsibility to say casual speculative tweeting.

I like the second approach: increase direct risk exposure (or lower moral hazard). You want a million dollar research grant to study race and IQ? Go for it. We just ask that you live in a black inner city school district while doing so, that will be applying your findings.

You want to speculate about sex markets? Great, do it in a sociology department where you have more female peers than male. Better still: include them in proposal.

Get skin in the game in proportion to the accidental harm you might do to others.

The common response to free-expression absolutism is “freedom of expression is not freedom from consequences”... as in don’t expect people to not yell at you or retaliate. If only it were that simple.

The real messy problem is *others may not be free from consequences*

To bring it back to the opening point, how do you judge a thinker? By topic, not method. 

How by topic? If a thinker routinely indulges in morally hazardous thinking where others are more likely to be hurt by erroneous conclusions, I do a double take.

If they aren’t adding extra safety or taking on extra risk to compensate, I flip the bozobit.

I’m doing this more quickly these days. There’s no excuse for putting others at risk with your bad thinking from relative safety.

I’m fine with sloppy speculative spitballing and casual, loud, public thinking. That’s my own modus operandi after all. The trick is to then work on harmless topics and/or ones where you yourself are the one most at risk. If you want to move to meltdown topics, harden you methods

## 22. Rules of Social Media Engagement, 2019

*January 1, 2019*

By way of Happy New Year wishes, here’s what I hope can be a helpful, perhaps even a bit healing thread, as we enter Year 5 of our culture wars. 

This thread is rated UN-13: Unironic and suitable for Normies, possibly disturbingly adult for children under 13.

You’re a channel in a 7 billion channel universe. There are no NPCs (“non-playable characters”) here. Whether or not you make a living off media, you’re a part of it. Even if only 5 people follow you, and 3 are family, and you only do DMs/texts/emails, you’re an active agent.

How should you use your reach, whether small or big? Who (not what) deserves attention? What form should that attention take? 

Your personal rules of engagement that you choose for yourself, times 7 billion = our world.

A key rule of engagement: whose sensitivities should you respect? 

Almost NOTHING is stopping you from offending anyone you want. Despite what you may have heard, it’s trivial to hurt anyone  while keeping yourself mostly safe. Safe addictive sadism is feature #1 of the Internet

Talking about anything you like and ignoring any sensitivities disturbed is actually kinda a legit shortcut to fame now. There’s MANY alt-media infrastructures, circuits of podcasts/blogs, and devoted support-with-$ audiences  that will fast-lane you to *profitable* alt-celebrity

So long as you actually dislike people you break away from, and like the people waiting to welcome you, being “censored” by people you offend is a reliable Streisand-effect trigger to alt-fame among others who dislike them. The fastest route to the top. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect

I’ve been in this game ~12 years now, mostly being sensitive to causing offense, avoiding needless provocation, shutting up on topics where I thought others might know better or have more legitimate voices. 

Basically staying in my lane by some notion of courtesy in my head.

Result? A variety of less inhibited people have zoomed to 100x my reach in 1/10th the time screaming “I’m being censored!” all the way 😂

Cracks me up. 

Zero regrets. I like the platform and rules of engagement I’ve built for myself. There are 7b like it but this one is mine.

I did learn the “edgy” playbook in a previous life and decided I didn’t like the tradeoffs involved in using it to get big reach. It really isn’t very hard. In more peaceful times we called it link-baiting. There is a robotic script to being an edgy taboo-shattering provocateur

Social reach is a pick-2-of-3: fast, cheap, good.

If you acquire big reach fast, and cheaply (by gratuitously offending people etc) the reach won’t be good. And by that I mean by *your* standards, not mine. You’ll find yourself in bed with people you’ll want to disavow later.

Fast+good = get paid by an institution. If you’re aligned, that’s good. If you’re misaligned it’s torture. And despite all the moaning about narrative monocultures and the Discourse, there’s plenty of varied institutional outlets to fit almost every sensibility. Look around.

If you’re actually any good, and willing to jump through some hoops, you’ll find institutions willing to fund *anything* you want to do/say. The problem is not lack of variety but too much competition. What you want said is probably already being said, professionally and better.

That leaves us with cheap+good, giving up on fast. 

“Good” reach doesn’t mean you won’t piss people off. You always will. But it will be a side effect of your creative work rather than your unconscious wounds and repressed demons.

You’ll piss the right people off for the right reasons, and if they compete, they‘ ll do so via substance in their work based on alternate premises, not via toxic beefs or cheap “debates.” 

And if they win, you’ll actually appreciate it because  knowledge will have been produced

But more importantly, your *own* reach will be “good” in the sense that relationships you form will be real human ones that you’ll want to keep for life most of the time. Where you might be on different sides of specific reductive labels but on the same side of “human.”

Because ultimately “censorship” in free parts of the Internet (without Chinese characteristics) only matters if you care about the people who can’t hear or talk to you. 

If you don’t, screaming “censorship” is posturing. You’re being heard by the people you want to be heard by.

But If you do, learn to find and connect to *both* the humans beneath the partially overlapping tag clouds. Yes, forming a for-life-by-default deep connection with another human being means connecting to a hidden part of yourself as well.

In fact, many hidden parts. Every deepening of the relationship is a new way to continue the infinite game between you two, a deeper knowledge of yourself and the other. And yet you’ll never be clones so long as you’re alive and thinking for yourself.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games

So in 2019, do yourself a favor and forget about the people “censoring” you and instead focus on people with whom you might be able to form a slowly deepening infinite-game relationship for life, peeling away label after label, connecting as two entangled full humans.

If this sounds like marriage that’s no accident. Marriage is merely the relationship where failure to operate in “till death do us part” mode is costliest. But it’s an ethos you can bring to any relationship you value. You can’t invest this much in 7 billion but you can do ~150.

I don’t care what your tribe is, but I hope you’ll build it slow+cheap or cheap+good. I hope you resist the temptation of fast+cheap. I don’t care about your ideology/politics. All I care about is that you build your social world around the “good” reach of for-life relationships.

If you do that — make it a resolution perhaps — then even if I violently disagree with you about everything from immigration to IQ to climate change, I’ll defend your right to exist and do your thing your way, with your chosen people, and I suspect you’d do the same for me.

So happy new year, here’s to a good 2019, and let’s try to wind this dumb culture war of fast-and-cheap tribes as quickly and painlessly as we can. We’ve all got better things to do. 

Really. 

Even if it seems right now that “owning” your outgroup is the best game in the world.

## 23. The Nutrition Transition

*January 7, 2019*

I’m seeing an interesting parallel between my work gigs on energy  transition stuff (fossil fuels + combustion tech  to renewables+electricity tech) and personal life efforts to gradually move to a plant-based diet. Cc @vegan @RyanBethencourt

I’m not vegan. I’m what airlines call ovo-lacto vegetarian, gradually substituting lower-cruelty products into lifestyle. Rarely buy milk anymore. Oat/soy/almond work well enough. But still on yogurt, cheese for some uses. Free-range eggs only and starting to swap in Just Egg.

Factory farming really is like the oil industry in many ways, and going plant-based is like going renewables-based. But the trick to energy transitions is to switch all the energy *end uses* to electrified devices. What’s the equivalent in food? Plantization.

Switching from an IC engine to an electric motor is about reinventing the application around the electricity stack. This is like inventing an egg substitute. The application is egg-like culinary function (like cars are transport function).

Developing a plant-based protein that can scramble like an egg is like developing a battery with the power-to-weight ratio and capacity characteristics needed for cars. In the latter case, Li-ion was the revolution. Here, perhaps Just Egg’s mung-bean isolate is lead-acid stage

I think we’ll see a Nutrition Transition starting in about 20-50 years that will eventually be as huge as the ongoing Energy Transition. More sustainable and cruelty-free stack (with smaller resource footprint) with 10x better economics and quality of life that’s equal or better.

Tons of nutrition transition tech in the pipeline that works better and better for plant-based functional substitution. Plus of course lab-grown meat too. And on the human side, who knows... gene editing to change our digestion system.

Natural meat need not vanish. It might end up in about a century or two as a minor “special experience” technology, like tourist attraction steam engines or horse riding, or in the future, IC-engine cars. Natural meat will be a “stunt” food like say ostrich eggs today.

I don’t really think of nutrition and food in a culturally essentialist way. As far as food is concerned, humans might as well be robots. We just need a supply that does the job and has a sensory UX our brain expects and enjoys. Valued cultural experiences can be ported.

And in more extreme environments (Mars colonies, seasteads) this will be primary feasible approach: rebase the nutrition stack on the lowest complexity biology we can possibly compile it down to. Why stop at complex plants. Can go down to algae. Maybe even non-living feedstocks.

Meat-eaters today are attached to their steaks, but we vegetarians are equally attached to apples and beans and lettuce. There is no reason artificial apples and beans can’t be made that mimic the experience with increasing fidelity the way vegan burgers are mimicking meat ones.

Ultimately, the only limit is fundamental physics. It’s all atoms and joules. The soylent guys have the right idea, just 50 years too soon, and with a really poor “food UX.” I’d like reasonable simulations of apples and eggs, not nutritionally sufficient mush.

And why stop at simulations of natural foods? What’s so natural about potato chips anyway? It’s a process combining oil from one plant, tubers from another, and salt, to produce crisp discs that have no analogue in nature. Yet we love them (especially when marketed “all natural”)

Walk down any grocery store aisle: a vast proportion of foods on sale are very far from “natural”. Even produce. Modern carrots, bananas, oranges are hundreds of generations of careful breeding away from natural ancestors. And we’re not even talking GMOs (which I’m all for).

But once you let go “natural” aesthetics, there is an unlimited universe of food experiences that can be crafted that have no historic roots in traditional culinary practices or “nature.” We can go as far from nature in food as we’ve gone in art from naturalism to modernism.

Sure there are dangers to “authoritarian high modernist” food tech that “legibilizes” food and culinary traditions, but that didn’t stop evolution in any other technology. You just manage the risks along the way. Can’t make vegan omelets without breaking some vegan eggs.

Accept there will be weird accidents etc. Like the famous Olean “anal leakage” episode. Notice btw how much “unnatural” weirdness we accept to look good/lose weight. Why not to avoid cruelty? Is one less suffering animal a fundamentally different goal than a hairless six-pack?

Every tech weathers risks as it evolves. Collapsing bridges crashing planes, exploding rockets, driverless cars crashing in weird ways, experimental drugs that cause birth defects. The Nutrition Transition will have it’s share of such risks. But the goal is worthwhile.

When it comes to the mind/consciousness, I’m a bit of a vitalist. When it comes to food, I’m not. Food is just another physics/chemistry basedy sensory modality field that just needs more engineering and software to simulate than visual fields through VR/AR.

Here’s to the Nutrition Transition, a cruelty-free world, and Simulated Food Reality (SFR). We should be at Star Trek level food replicators from raw atoms and joules by 2234 if we get going now.

## 24. Design for Mediocrity

*January 21, 2019*

One reason I champion mediocrity is that alternative is obviously dystopian:

Upper class of exceptional superhumans

Middle class of robots

Lower class of broken, institutionalized people who failed to be exceptional, and regressed right past human mean to “driven crazy.”

The polyannish hope is basically Lake Wobegon: almost everybody “above average” in some magical sense with maybe a few broken people in nice, humane 5-star mental institutions. This does not track with regression to the mean.

Human basic material well-being floor can and does improve (everything from infant mortality to protein intake to height) but the amount of mediocrity in the system decreases much more slowly and I think has a hard lower limit.

Why?

Dimensionality of human experience! Well-known statistics fact: high dimensional distributions have more “weight” at the extremes. You need more “ways to human” to move more people from mediocre to exceptional (if you want to do that at all).

You can have Lake Wobegon if there’s as many ways to excel as people. Everybody gets humaning participation trophy for being best at something. The problem with this is a) there’s no grounding in survival/adaptation truth signal b) it’s not actually a fun human condition

In case it isn’t obvious, everybody best at something = everybody worst at the same thing = no variation for natural selection = cultural evolution at a degenerate stall condition. In practice it means evolution proceeds via illegible selection pressures under overwrought order

In fact even when there is enough dimensional room for all, people will congregate in a few. Humans *want* community enough they’d rather be average in the competitive company of at least a subculture than “excellent” by default as the sole person doing something.

Where’s there is collective experience there are comparisons, variations, selections... and cream/middle/dregs parts of the distribution. This is a good thing. Don’t try to stack-rank humanity by skimming off the cream and destroying the rest.

The existence of mediocrity is a consequence of humans valuing sociability enough to give up some exceptionalism for it. I write in part because writing is work where I can have company, even if it means being mostly mediocre at it and dealing with resulting social consequences.

We’re also smarter as a collective species than as individuals. Yes there’s a tax of bureaucracy/“innovation by committee” but hive minds of grain-fed runts still out-evolved scattered beef-only nomad barbarians. Only takes a small dose of exceptionalism and it’s Advantage Borg.

So for a) social psychological reasons b) efficiencies of scale/concentration c) higher collective intelligence. The human condition is always lower dimensional than what technology allows, and is a function of population, not possibility.

Mediocrity is safety net of psyche. You sustain it by creating modes of being that *large numbers of people can participate in at acceptable levels in Borg/Death Star mode*. This is in fact what the “democratization” of platform capitalism is. Clouds of average human computers.

Democratization is mediocratization. The reduction in the number of special traits (genetic, educational, virtues, class) required to participate in a function. The fundamental contradiction inherent in hustle porn and celebration of excellence is ignoring this powerful force.

With apologies to A. N. Whitehead, civilization advances by extending the number of operations humans can perform without being exceptional or OCD.

You want to level up the world? Replace a genius function, not with an AI, but with something a half-engaged slacker can phone in.

Seattle is squeezing mediocrity hard right now. And predictably there’s more, and crazier, homeless people on the streets, whose mental health/drug use is a bigger issue than their poverty. Almost as bad as San Francisco now. This is what happens when you wage war on mediocrity.

Be careful what you wish for in wishing mediocrity would go away. You’re saying: make it to the top or break down and fall to the human garbage pile. Mediocrity is  sustainable “fake it a bit till you die happy” option. Not “fake it till you make it or fail and die of insanity.”

Mediocritism isn’t socialism by the way. Capitalism is a 10x better engine of mediocratization than any kind of socialism *if* you don’t fetishize it. I suspect vaguely socialist modes of societal organization emerge as an overcompensation when mediocrity is stressed too hard.

This happens when exceptionalists and excellentists drink their own “meritocracy” kool-aid too much and start believing in master races, superhumans and other statistically dubious eugenics fever dream misreadings of how capitalism actually works.

Ironically you know what’s a sure sign of mass exceptionalist thinking? Overly muscular systems of “meritocracy” thinking. You know where they believe super strongly in that? China. It’s the party line that all Chinese are above average if you standardize testing enough.

Capitalism works not by raising floor or ceiling but by dragging up middle via democratization-mediocratization. Misreading this is basically a case  of  being so terrified of being merely ordinary, and people who accept a contemporary ordinary life, you wage war on mediocrity.

So dare to be ordinary, huddle in the middle, slack off, say fuck-off to excellence/meritocracy/hustle religions and Make Meh Great Again 🙂

## 25. Killing People to Reboot Things

*January 24, 2019*

It’s when you consider problems like air traffic control (ATC) on a busy continent that practical problems with libertarianism become apparent. It’s a tightly synchronized federated architecture (ie a network of locally centralized entities) that’s hard to “libertarianize”

There have been technical proposals over last 20 years for distributed ATC protocols (planes coordinating directly with each other) requiring low or zero ground control elements. After all birds fly around without ATCs. The problem is transitioning to such systems.

The existing solution is decades old, with a lot of metis (tacit knowledge) accumulated over the years. Switching away from it is 1000x harder than switching away from the QWERTY keyboard. It’s about as hard as switching regular money to crypto. Doable in principle, cost unclear.

Recipe: take some snazzy cutting-edge decentralized ATC ideas (for eg like https://news.engin.umich.edu/2018/11/decentralized-air-traffic-control-for-drone-laden-skies/), throw in AlphaGo to mine all the metis from historical records, re-solve it better starting from blank slate like AlphaGoZero, download to all your planes/drones, fire all ATCs.

You can imagine the end state: no ATCs at all. Planes and airlines do it all in decentralized software, government gets out of the act, tickets cost a bit more to pay for it all, taxes go down more, everybody wins. The Lords Koch are happy, 1 step closer to night-watchman state.

Wouldn’t it be lovely if we could have software, decentralization, and blockchain eat ALL government functions this way? Nothing for governments to do, nothing to be shut down. Ayn Rand smiles down from her place in insane heaven.

The problem with this scenario is that the transition cost might well be “collapse of civilization.” Transitioning a function like ATC to decentralized utopian future might be, to coin a phrase, “collapse complete.” You might have to blow it ALL up to achieve ONE such transition.

That’s the problem with a lot of libertarian visions. They are quite possibly collapse complete. Achieving any one of them might require “collapse” as a transient state. ATC is just one of dozens of critical “stack  realities” (public health, disaster relief, food security...)

But there may be non-collapse clever pathways to achieve such transitions. We’re navigating one (energy) right now. The small problem is some are impatient and want to try blowing up what we have to redo the whole thing, taking a leap of faith that it’s NOT collapse complete.

The BIG problem is that many believe such transitions ARE in fact unavoidably collapse complete and *still* want them. Effectively they want to bunker down with civilizational crown jewels/reboot plans, let us other 99% subhumans die off, and emerge from bat caves to rule in 2119

These are awful people, but they do exist, do hold such views and serious power, and do in fact react with glee to progress in BTFSTTG (burn the fucking shit to the ground) plans. 200 years ago BTFSTTG was a silly dream. In 2019, it could actually be done (reboot not guaranteed)

These are  “Sometimes Going Galt needs a Donald Trump to clear the way” people. Aka Claremont conservatives operating with a “Flight 93” theology. A sort of “we must burn it all down to save it” mindset. https://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/the-flight-93-election/

Now we technological pragmatists still want to get to nice decentralized future outcomes, but we want to muddle through, in a messy, constant “under construction” slouching-towards-utopia way. We don’t want to blow it all up. We don’t want to BTFSTTG along the way.

This is why the shutdown concern me. This isn’t like previous shutdowns. This is a shutdown with a lot of BTFSTTG types in power. Their BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) is collapse. Maybe not ATC, but they’d like to see a lot of stack realities collapse for good

Sure the risk of a crash caused by a fatigued unpaid controller moonlighting driving Lyft, leading to a strike, is low. But I bet there’s BTFSTTG people thinking “we could use a gory crash to force privatization of ATC, on the road to automation and eventual elimination. Win!”

Government shrinkage by starvation collapse —> privatize —> automate. Gut what you can, when you can to transition it to your utopian state via crash chaos.  There’s  people in power who actually want lots of things to break and not be fixed. Reaganomics but with violent sadism.

This is why, though I actually share many libertarian and ancap end goals, I don’t identify as either. I think most of them fetishize technology in illiterate sci-fi ways, understand it in micro bits that makes them overconfident about macro things, and are basically sadists.

Starting a slide towards a Hobbesian world because they think they can come out the other end as winners. Because they’re idiots who think because they’re rich, they must be smart. Because they like apocalypse movies, they must be like The Rock themselves.

Am I overstating things? Well, here we are, talking about diverting actual disaster relief funds to build a symbolic wall and wondering if it will take an airplane crash to get governance back, by people who will then predictably exploit the tragedy to burn more things down.

This is what lunatics running the asylum looks like. Not “move fast and break things” which could at least be justified as calibrated risk-taking.

No, this is “deliberately break things and hurt/kill people to reboot things” sadistic playbook.

Happy Day 34 of a shutdown world.

## 26. Snobby Holmesean Cases with Singular Features

*January 29, 2019*

I'm becoming more snobby about work than I can probably afford to be from a financial perspective. Like Sherlock Holmes, I require "singular features" to take a case. I can spot the consulting equivalent of a "evidence of cheating spouse for a divorce case" a mile off now.

A big truth of work-adulting is that 90% of business problems are at best mildly stimulating and tricky the first 3 times, and then boring and straightforward for n>3. You just have to grind through them. They require neither book smarts nor street smarts. Just sweat and time.

The only ways to make them “interesting” is to 

a) add more money
b) add more unmodelable risk
c) add an interpersonal caring dimension for someone you like/love or dislike/hate
d) add a self-care dimension (proving yourself after self-esteem blow, healing narcissistic wound)

If $ and risk don’t motivate you, you have to either find the remaining 10% of problems or go into other fields. I’d say 90% of the 10% interesting business problems (ie 9% of total) are at VP+ levels, but the 1% lurking lower down food chain are the very best problems.

Unless you find this 10%, almost any other field has a higher proportion of “interesting”

Engineering/Art: 30-80% interesting 
Housework: 20-40% interesting

Even the *boring* parts are more interesting. Routine tech calculations, “laying pipe” in novel writing, folding laundry

Typical “90% boring part” problems: dealing with problem coworker/boss/report, navigating a tedious political conflict involving people you don’t give a shit about, interpreting sales data, reading balance sheets, rerunning a spreadsheet model for the 4th year in a row.

People are generally paid in proportion to how much boredom they take on. And the boredom is a mark of competence by the way. Anyone who loves these problems past n=3 is likely cluelessly awful at dealing with them. Their incompetence lends interestingness to routine stuff.

In 2019, with everybody either exhorting you to “learn to code” or “become an entrepreneur” it is good to know why neither might fit you. Coding is easy to eliminate. You find out fairly quickly the hard way (6-12 months) whether you have a feel for it and are good at it.

Entrepreneurship is harder. The primary qualification is the courage to be bored for long periods of time without getting distracted. At least 5 years. Like, 90% of the time until an org of people to do the boring bits exists under your authoritah. I lack this.

If you’re not bored by the 90% you lack the imagination to solve the 10%. If you don’t have the courage you won’t endure 5 years of boredom. Life FOMO will claim you (“there’s got to be more to life than playing half a dozen games that seem to involve gearing ‘no’ repeatedly!”)

And if you eliminate both coding and entrepreneurship what’s left?

Everything else.

## 27. Blue Collar Innovation

*February 2, 2019*

A thread on innovation theory pointing out some connections that have been clear in my head for years, but I’m realizing are not even visible to many people interested in the topic. I’m always surprised when I have to point these things out and pass along these references.

In the history of innovation revolutions, after the pioneer stage but before the institutional phase, you usually have a “blue-collar innovator mutual-influence network”, BCIMIN, basically consisting of people dropping in on each other’s workspaces and freely stealing tricks.

Here I overload “blue-collar innovator” to mean anyone producing stuff using an emerging medium of any sort, not just physical making. So early bloggers or first cohort of bands in a new music scene count.  Sorry if that offends your class sensibilities but it’s the best term.

Out of necessity they have to work on/around deficiencies of medium and get hands dirty. Typically they are much more deeply knowledgeable about their tools than later institutional era non-innovator blue-collar types, who will also work at the tool level, but at stable maturity.

Often they may seem “overqualified” for the tool level. Early computing pioneers like Turing, von Neumann, and Richard Hamming were often mathematicians who knew vastly more math than modern programmers ever learn. If formally credentialed, they may look like they’re slumming it.

Interesting datapoint: much of the hands-on early work on drones and driverless cars was done at university labs by people getting Masters or PhD degrees. They did everything from soldering to writing advanced math papers. But today a high-school kid can work with the tech.

But credentials are not necessary for a BCIMIN. Only the impedance mismatch between the depth of knowledge and experience being brought to bear on the work, and the seemingly “beneath them” level of hands-on-work and mucking about at the tool level.

I’ve seen credentialed, decorated types literally turn up their noses with “this is contractor/intern/newbie grunt work”. When a respected, high-reputation person says something like that, I immediately flip the bozobit and look skeptically at their supposed great reputation.

Invariably I find they’ve been doing shallow, dull work aimed at racking up institutional merit points (number of papers/patents, awards etc). They are the Paris Hiltons of innovation. Famous for being famous. A resume stuffed with everything except blue-collar innovation.

Blue-collar innovators are “new medium pilot plant” producers. Their workspaces/tooling are inbetween basic research labs and scaled production. They produce in small batches not because they have artisan sensibilities but because they’re pushing the scaling limits of new media.

BCIMINs are the most stimulating and energizing place for most smart, creative, imaginative, and growth-oriented people to participate in. It’s not the rare lightning-strike regime that creates pioneers, nor is it the predictable world of institutions built around stable tools.

I’d guess 1% of the population will end up as pioneers, 9% as blue-collar innovators, and 90% as mature-institution normies. Of that 90%, a third to half (so 30-45% of total) will be bullshit workers, predators and parasites at maturity. Free riders of one sort or the other.

This is fine. I approve of non-producing free riders right up to the point that kills the host process of wealth creation. It’s only good wealth if it produces a surplus, and somebody has to consume it. Somebody has to eat all that cake.

Modern startup ecosystems and open-source communities before large-scale financialization are of course the most familiar example of BCIMINs, but it’s a more general phenomenon. See for example steam engines after James Watt’s patents expired: https://www.jstor.org/stable/23603566?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

Robert Allen called BCIMINs “collective invention settings” (his concept is the basis for the paper above). A more contemporary model is settler phase of Cringley’s pioneer-settler-town planner model which @swardley incorporated into his mapping model. https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html

The model applies to cultural production too. See the idea of scene-hacking from @sebpaquet https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/vgururao/scene-hacking

And to general intellectual production. See Fred Turner on “network celebrity” https://fredturner.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Turner-Larson-Network-Celebrity-PC-2015.pdf

See also @Meaningness on the underlying social evolution process. https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths

BCIMINs are a *natural* expression of human motivations. When they are repressed, potential blue-collar innovators turn to crime and other pathological activities. You can’t get rid of the 9%. See this Baumol paper. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2937617?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

For fun fictional portraits of a BCIMIN era, try Terry Pratchett’s Raising Steam or HBO’s Deadwood. 

Let’s finish with some subtle takeaways.

1. Innovation watchers often uncritically fetishize either credentialed expertise or unqualified blue-collar doerism. Nope. BCIMINs run on expertise (credentialed or not) *slumming at blue-collar levels*. Get this wrong and you’ll end up either academic posturing or JohnHenryism.

2. The 90% normies often assume the 1% pioneers are the only ones who matter and form “scenes” of personality cults around them. The 9% BCIMIN types are often viewed with suspicion and become targets of societal policing. This never works. They just turn to crime etc.

3. Unlike the 1%, who have a love-hate tortured relationship with fame and the attention of the 90%, the 9% neither attract, nor crave the spotlight. But they will not toe the lines or conform to societal norms or social proof either. They’ll tolerate some spotlight as a burden.

4. They aren’t a community. They are a network of competing/cooperating individuals stealing tricks from each other. Ideas diffuse slowly through the BCIMIN, as each skeptically tests tricks before adopting. It’s not viral meme floods. It’s a slow network with fad defenses.

All this is fairly well-known and uncontroversial to students of innovation history. But people who enter BCIMINs attracted by 1% personality cults or with an uncritical fetish for either credentials or blue-collarism invariably don’t last. They crash and burn as scenesters.

## 28. Fractals, Foxes, and Hedgehogs

*February 17, 2019*

“The fox knows many things, the hedgehog knows one big thing” — Isaiah Berlin

A question: how do foxes and hedgehogs “know” fractal realities, self-similar across scales? How do they act on them?

Answer: badly but in different ways.

Cauliflowers collapse cognition: a thread

Fractals are the enemy of tractable ontology. They suck hedgehog attention down to lowest level/highest resolution phenomenology, destroying efficient abstraction hierarchies, and cause foxes to degenerate into vertigo-inducing scale-free apophenia. Why?

The only “efficient” kind of scale-free thinking is recursive thinking, and human brains are bad at it. Maybe we have limited stack capacity. This is why puzzles like the “blue forehead” are hard. The logic isn’t hard, but it involves recursion. https://curiosity.com/topics/the-blue-forehead-brain-teaser-curiosity/

Imagine approximating a cauliflower with a solid that follows contours of largest florets using a parametrized mushroom-shaped primitive. That would cause both positive/negative errors (solid where empty, empty where solid). That’s a good example of a fractal map-territory error.

To get more accuracy you would use a smaller “mushroom” as your 3D tesselation primitive. All the way down to the smallest where you’d get “riced” cauliflower (down to rice-sized pieces). The basic idea of fractal models is to use geometrically similar primitives at all scales.

The “coastline of Norway” is a more conventional example but I prefer cauliflowers since they are things we act on, by chopping etc. The “right way” to chop a cauliflower, as my buddy @bumblebeelabs once observed, is “recursively”.

Recursive chopping is when you decide on a target floret size (say 1/2”) and break down big florets to roughly that size. It will never be perfect. But you can get most of the mass under a hard upper limit of size in the form of florets with integrity. There Will Be Crumbles.

Most good cauliflower recipes call for a floret-integrity-preserving deconstruction (I detest things like mashed cauliflower which destroy its character 🤬). But it’s possible to take a simpler chopping approach. Like the dicing of potato.

Chopping cauliflower with a potato technique leads to a lot of waste for a target size. Imagine “dicing” cauliflower into half-inch cubes using knife strokes that follow a cuboidal grid. You’d get unpredictable fragments. But the smaller your target size, the less it matters.

At the limit, to get to “riced” cauliflower, the technique kinda doesn’t matter: recursive chopping, dicing, and grating, all lead to roughly the same results: a cauliflower-insulting state good only for mushy potato or rice substitution. Structural destruction is path agnostic.

That’s what pure hedgehogs do: getting very detail-oriented by reducing the cauliflower to limit where fractal geometry gives way to the next lower level of organization (cellular).  They destroy what they can’t grok, to reduce to a perfect “one big thing” lower-level idea.

Pure foxes otoh get attached to maintaining the integrity of the loose “floret” primitive to the point where they can’t recursively chop at all, since every cut, whether fractal or dicing, causes “non-floret-like error” to accumulate. There Will Be Crumbles. And stemmy bits.

Because there’s no “flat” (1 level/size band) approximate breakdown with no “errors” (ie only floret shapes and within a size band with non-trivial upper and lower limits), the fox is tempted to deep fry the whole, holistic cauliflower so to speak. Or more likely, do nothing.

(More technically, every reduction to a size band between 0 (riced) and 1 (whole cauliflower) either introduces new “fake” primitives like weird “stem junction cubes” that are artifacts of decomposition technique, or violates a lower size bound).

Because the fox “knows many things” (the florets in their analogical variety, across sizes and parametric shape variations), *any* chopping is too destructive and they freeze into inaction. This is one failure mode induced by fractal realities.

Because the hedgehog  “knows one big thing” that won’t tolerate fractal variety, they destroy the whole thing and tame it with brute force. This is another failure mode induced by fractal realities.

Both are driven by fear of incompleteness of existing knowledge.

In both cases the solution is to accept that *any* action will change reality in a way that makes your previous knowledge incomplete. So you either have to destroy the reality entirely or accept that creative destructive action creates bits that don’t fit what you know.

Basically the only error-free map is the entire territory. Hedgehogs forcefully tame it into “rice”, foxes leave it untouched, representing the “floret gestalt”. Destroy the territory through reductionism, or treat it like a holistic map with no agency for you.

Non-fractal realities don’t have this property. For example, animals are not fractal. So a simpler level-by-level deconstruction works. This is Lao Tze’s butcher, taking reality apart at joints elegantly. Disassembly without fractal chopping. Our normal thinking is like this.

Under normal conditions, we tend to use “stack” thinking: a set of single-level, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE) mental models. We ignore fractal error. We move abstraction levels as necessary, trusting state to stay well-behaved.

Stack structures can be navigated with lightweight stacks in the computing sense. This is because they follow a finite ontogeny recipe. 

But large-scale *growing* realities tend to be fractal in macro structure. When you try to navigate them with stack logic, things fall apart.

The @EpsilonTheory essay “As Above, So Below” in the “things fall apart” series gets at this. https://www.epsilontheory.com/things-fall-apart-part-3-politics/

My gloss on that is: under normal conditions stack thinking in a fractal world causes fractal map-territory errors that self-correct via foxes and hedgehogs serving as checks and balances on each other. That’s complex systems homeostasis.

But in weird conditions, they compound fractally, collapsing at all levels. The widening-gyre effect. Hedgehogs become part of problem by getting destructive. Foxes give up in frozen inaction. The system gets ungovernable. Self-correction homeostasis breaks down, all unravels.

The solution is to “think entangled, act spooky” as I recently argued. To arrest and reverse a fractal collapse you have to think in fractal-native scale-free ways. How do you do that in practice? I don’t know yet. Working on it. https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/09/11/think-entangled-act-spooky/

## 29. Risk vs. Depth

*March 3, 2019*

Realizing I’ve never actually learned anything non-tactile/physical (like swimming or bike-riding) as a result of explicitly trying to learn it. It’s always been a side effect of something else (like reading for pleasure) or wanting to do or make something.

All my explicit “study” habits suck. I don’t take notes, I rarely go “back to basics” to read foundational “classics”, I don’t do practice exercises unless they are like puzzles for fun (a criterion is satisfied by most math-based skills fortunately). I don’t learn “good form”

I do have what you might call “wild cousin” behaviors to disciplined learning. I repeat good stories I’ve heard. I put a lot of direct quotes and oblique references in my writing. I tend to think about everyday contemporary topics where relevant information is socially cached.

At a macro level, everything I do is unapologetically, even gleefully derivative in some sense. Any value comes from the risk rather than skill or imagination. Eg: using The Office to interpret management theory, without being skilled at either screenwriting or textbook MBA stuff

This is not “making connections across fields” (which requires some depth in to/from fields. Nor is it playing “chess postman” which requires some careful systematic left-brained bridge building. It’s more like shallow right-brained arbitrage.

This is a very lean, differential-diagnosis focused survivalist thinking style that basically surfs the learning already in the environment and/or embeddable in natural work output. A mediocre-small-brain style. It has strengths (speed being big one) but also serious blind spots.

First, it doesn’t work on topics that aren’t simultaneously being worked by lots of other people. Preferably focused types who are likely to miss obvious things that are in peripheral vision or first-order “irrelevant”. So you can’t do far out stuff being worked by like 5 people.

Second, it doesn’t work on things that require skill stacks deeper than 2. An example is building hardware/software integrated things, which is at least about 3 layers deep (physical design, physical fabrication, software). This is an interesting one...worth a <sidebar>

I don’t think I ever made/hacked/repaired anything non-trivial more than 1 layer deep. For eg, I’ve built decently complex model gliders, rigged up electronics layer for stuff with existing hardware/software things, and fixed 1-factor issues (eg pure electrical or pure plumbing)

...but I’ve never made or hacked anything requiring 2 stack layers. Eg full model plane with remote controls. Closest I came was a kit robot but I never got past a few hello-world programs that made it go around in circles. I quit when I couldn’t fix a simple coupled problem...

If you’re curious, I couldn’t get wheel alignment perfect. So an open-loop straight line program would cause a slow turn. I’d have had to either true the steering, compensate in software or design and add a position feedback sensor loop... lost patience, gave up.

Same story in software. Software has both stack levels (source, compiled, environment...) and lifecycle stages (dev/production). I’ve built complex single-level/single-stage things (Matlab basically) but go to 2, and I’ve never gotten beyond hello-world level complexity.

Implication: I only hold 1 context in head at a time and largely surf natural dynamics in that context intuitively, and by learning patterns of “luck”. Go to 2 contexts and intuition breaks, coupled 2-context good luck becomes unlikely, “normal accident” bad luck becomes likely

This is almost the definition of least-effort slacking. The one mitigating factor is that sometimes a context boundary that is taken seriously by others is not actually real so you can exploit a broader single context and seem like a holistic mind-like-water systems thinker.

Example: sociology and management theory are pretty much the same. You need no context switching between them really, just some jargon mapping. Intuition and insight-luck patterns work in nearly seamless ways across them. Ignore the boundary and you’ll look like a genius.

Sometimes you get really meta-lucky and see a really “long” single-context pathway cutting across multiple specialized stack levels/lifecycle stages. Like a wormhole through learning space. Any move you make in this wormhole context looks like magic to disciplined learners.

I *think* this is what looks like “strategic insight” (coup d’oeil) from the outside. It’s really a cheap exploit in the landscape of other people’s socially embodied institutional ways of knowing, due to improbable concurrences of insubstantial context boundaries. End </sidebar>

Third, it doesn’t work on things that take more time than social-cache-refresh time constants. For example, “blockchain” was in hive mind for a year, so I was having interesting thoughts about it. But serious work on blockchain takes 3+ yrs. So I’m recession-weak on the subject.

If I had to name this thinking/pseudo-learning style given its tricks, strengths, and weaknesses, it would probably be “parasitic”. Low-energy, low-effort, derivative survivalism. Like the grasshopper in ant and grasshopper story. 

Occasionally predatory rather than parasitic.

If you find this inspirational/aspirational at some level, curb your enthusiasm. It’s more curse than blessing. There’s something very unsatisfying about this, which is why every year or two I take a run at a “deeper” project that would come easier to disciplined learners.

Hasn’t worked yet, but I’m optimistic I’ll eventually do at least one 2+ layer deep thing in my life that’s more than right-brained arbitrage/surfing or wormhole trickery of environmental learning.

## 30. The Cosmic Mirror Test

*March 7, 2019*

I’m in the non-apocalyptic camp of climate change believers. I don’t believe even the worst case will make the world uninhabitable. Let’s say that’s a 5% likelihood scenario of maybe 90% species loss and even 90% human population decline. But what do those numbers *mean*?

It means: between that extreme and say a middling collapse scenario, a range covering ~50% of outcomes, though the living Earth doesn’t end, the “world” as a shared human sense of place does. This would be a psyche trauma we may have in our future. One you could call soul-death.

Humans are the only species that seems to operate by an incoherent but poetic sense of inclusive fitness that includes all life. Call it the Gaia instinct. It is a weird instinct that makes us identify with all life, and extend our identity onto it via anthropomorphic projection.

When we look up at the stars a key thing we see reflected back is our sense of being part of the only known example of “life”. This is why we obsess over aliens and the Fermi paradox. Even false alarms of bacteria-level life get us excited. Oumuamua got us properly worked up.

That’s the Gaia instinct. The capacity to feel lonely when looking up at the stars. It’s a fairly new feeling. It requires a mix of: big telescopes, globalization, discovery of DNA as shared, non-divine basis for life, and a pale-blue-dot/one-earth outside-in view of ourselves.

I bet if we could know for certain there was no life out there, and no hope of interstellar travel, we’d lose 90% of our interest in space/astronomy. I’d still be personally interested, because I like stars, black holes and the idea of empty planets. But most would stop caring.

The cosmos is something like a figurative mirror in a cosmic mirror test. You pass the regular mirror test if you can recognize yourself in a mirror (as other apes, and even crows do). You pass the cosmic mirror test if you feel lonely/yearning when you look up at the sky.

Not all humans pass the cosmic mirror test or possess the Gaia instinct. Hardcore libertarians certainly don’t. Many traditionally religious types don’t. I suspect many “rationalists” who fetishize “optimization” don’t.  That’s okay. You’re all just a bit less evolved than me 😇

I think the common factor there is that because they believe in some non-corporeal god (efficient markets, traditional gods, post-singularity-AI and/or simulators) the spiritual valence of the material cosmos is... attenuated shall we say? Head-in-some-noosphere syndrome.

Passing the cosmic mirror test means at some level, you’re a sort of hyper-atheist. What we see is all there is. Everything else is comforting fiction. You must find both material sustenance and spiritual succor in these living/non-living atoms around us. There’s nothing else.

Ironically, we hyper-atheists are most vulnerable to soul death because we keep our souls in atoms around us. Those who believe in any religion keep souls in eternalist, aionic, safe spaces. There’s a nice Dr. House rant about why atheism makes you value life more, not less.

The universe is not exactly a mirror-of-living-earth, and potential alien life wouldn’t be a “reflection” but there would be sense of mutual recognition if we did find *any* life. Even if it was alien/predator/andromeda-strain style life that “recognizes” us by trying to kill us.

Back on earth, we’re not the only creatures with a sense of outer space (turtles and spiders orient towards the moon/stars for example) but we’re the only ones who experience the Gaia instinct and pass the cosmic mirror test. It’s not just a firmament with twinkling lights to us.

The earthbound side of the Gaia instinct is caring about an idea like “90% species extinction”. No other species is capable of caring about anything more than its immediate kin, predators, and prey. Local eco-web consciousness only. The Gaia instinct is for tech-modern humans.

As individuals we can feel an individual version of mutual recognition with almost any creature that we can respond to and that responds to us. Cats and dogs of course, but even trees and slugs. Even if that sense of mutuality is an “eww” or pang at cutting down an ancient tree.

THIS is what at risk. Life may go on even in the worse 50% of climate change outcomes, but the Gaia instinct might die. The world will end in the sense of an idea of ourselves reflected back when we look up. Even if we retain a gritty, anthropcene kind of cyber-paleo modernity.

What might end is the capacity to feel the kind of incredibly poignant loneliness that took Hubble, Pioneer 11, shipping containers, and a double helix to deliver to us. It might be the most precious emotion we’ve constructed for our minds to experience. Better than religion.

Our ability to feel this feeling might be perhaps the peak experience of being human if the worse climate futures play out. We might live on, but on a dispiriting subhuman journey. Or we beat the crisis and go on to experience way more on our many frontiers of the spirit.

You may not share this sensibility. But ask yourself: do you possibly not feel this because you’ve short-circuited your capacity to feel it by putting your “soul”, for lack of a better word, in an illusory place where it cannot die, but doesn’t truly live either?

This is ultimately what many of us are thinking/feeling when we talk about climate. We’re not secretly trying to shove Big Government down the world’s throat. We’re trying to prevent the soul-death of the world as we know it. Harsh as 90% collapse might be, soul death is worse.

## 31. Seen-It-All Syndrome

*March 21, 2019*

If you're reasonably open to experience, intelligent, and good at pattern matching, you'll arrive at a "seen it all" plateau by about age 35-50. It won't be true, but it will feel like it. Genuine, category/pattern busting surprise is harder to find past a point in our universe

People think this is not true because they conflate surprisal with unpredictability. They're not the same. I can't predict a sequence of coin tosses, but almost no sequence of heads/tails would surprise me.  It would take something like tosses producing pi in binary to do that

When you're a baby, surprise is a continuous state. When you're young, it comes overwhelmingly torrentially and you have to affect unflappability to seem cool. But by the time you're about 35, if you like surprise, a certain desperation to seek it out will creep into your life

Surprisal is a cognitive addiction of course, and a good one. But the hits get harder to produce. By 40, fracking surprise out of the universe turns into an advanced cognitive skill.

A naive response is "have you read all the books in the library yet?" or "have you taught yourself advanced quantum mechanics yet?" Former is plain silly. It becomes obvious fairly quickly in a reading life that humans have written 100x more books than they have things to say

The second response is trickier. Of course not all of us are genius enough to grok and appreciate surprisal hidden in depths of the advanced math of quantum mechanics and stuff. But here's the thing: demystifying a subject to drain it of surprise is FAR easier than working in it

Good pop science/math that is decently challenging can demystify a subject for you without giving you the mastery. And a taste of mastery is enough to tell you that there isn't as much surprise there as you might think.

The illusion of having "seen it all" is like the illusion of having found a "formula" for prime numbers that works up to some point. Of course the number of primes is infinite, but you can convince yourself you've seen them all if the next one is too far away for you to count to

Half of all meditation techniques are about regaining the easy-to-surprise beginner mind so ordinary magic of life can surprise in delight you again. 

The other half of meditation techniques are to console yourself because the first half doesn't work as well as advertised 😆

But "beginner mind" idea is right in essence. Except you have to generate the surprise within yourself. Thanks to our enormous capacities for denial etc. some of the deepest reserves for mystery and surprise are within you. You just have to be willing to look foolish to tap them

People dimly recognize this and try to pick up new skills and brave early-learning-curve awkwardness as a way to inject freshness into life again. That's not quite right. If you're an advanced pianist, fumbling at tennis won't really help rediscover the surprisability of age 9.

What WILL help is to blow up things where you think you already know it all and find ways to go all fumbling and awkward again. So our notional pianist has to find a way to be a fumbling beginner *at the piano* again.

Self-disruption basically. Trying to inject novelty into your life by learning unrelated new things is like trying to do 3 undergraduate degrees instead of 1 PhD. A series of degrees is a scripted series of self-disruptions. MS mind disrupts BS mind. PhD mind disrupts MS mind.

Doesn't work very well, but the more informal, less scripted version of developing a sense for when you've plateaued in some activity and blowing it up at the right time, to make it new again, but WITHOUT losing the experience earned... that's the real skill of surprise-seeking

Thank you for reading my long-winded justification for my writing mostly sucking this last year 😆

Addendum: there is a big element of surrender in accessing surprisal latent in the universe, and it becomes harder to surrender with age because we become addicted to agency. Even when risks are low, we resist. Kids surprise more easily because they surrender more easily.

## 32. Turing-Complete Identities

*March 31, 2019*

History is all the identities we’ve inhabited so far

Kinda makes sense that the end of history would be marked by terminal identitarianism. Consequence, not cause. If nobody can find a way to continue everybody’s identity evolution, history ends.

Identitarian consensus: when everybody agrees what boxes everybody is in. It’s a much deeper state of stable equilibrium than everybody simply having a fixed identity. The way common knowledge is a deeper equilibrium than mere belief or even mutual belief.

There was a funny Volkswagen ad where an Indian guy responds to some question about yoga with “just because I drive a Volkswagen you think I’m into yoga?”

It’s funny because it simultaneously acknowledges and subverts an identitarian consensus

Also Seinfeld anti-dentite joke

An identitarian consensus is also a set of roles and permissions within a narrative. Stereotyping is just the shallowest layer. History ends at an identitarian consensus not because the narrative ends but because it becomes 100% tropey

The instinct behind simple role-swaps (eg female or black superheroes) as a way to break out of an identitarian consensus equilibrium is solid but... naive. Like transposing a tune to a new key rather than composing a new one. Doesn’t restart history, just phase-shifts it.

An example of a history-restart type shift is from Campbellian Monomyth hero to LeGuinesque Carrier Bag unheroine. Doctor Who pulled that off, though it has other weaknesses.

Real history edition: when women stop leading like men. Good or bad, you can’t ignore the fact that it’s equilibrium-breaking history restart/reboot. This ain’t Margaret Thatcher or Indira Gandhi style https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/opinion/women-leadership-jacinda-ardern.html

The link between end of history and identitarian consensus also explains why “diversity” as a simplistic alternative to a straight-white-male-centric equilibrium doesn’t work for anything except post-apocalyptic survivalist stories. That’s just the aftermath of the end of history

To extend the music metaphor, this is not a transposition, it’s a polyphony degenerating into a cacophony. Random noise around an EoH equilibrium.

Experimenting with fiction has shown me just how terrible social identities are for writing believable, growing characters. It’s almost like trying to make an address behave like a house. A category error. An address can let you guess a lot about a house but isn’t itself a house.

Otoh, you can’t just make up a character from, say, a set of archetypal inner paradoxes. The context matters in a way that becomes immediately obvious when you try to name a character. A name instantly induces a world.

The thing about history-reboot level narratives is that any one local binding, like the name of a key character, immediately binds the rest of the narrative as well. Choosing any one thing is like choosing everything. And now the whole story is a clockwork deterministic universe.

The best you can do is “glitch” the global binding a bit by simultaneously acknowledging/subverting a piece of it, like my Volkswagen-yoga example. This is not an archetypal paradox driving a character OR a world paradox driving a history. It’s the nexus *between* the two.

This creates *just* enough room, like a 99.9% global binding instead of 100%, for history to get restarted. Tiny new root sneaking through the cracks of a tessellation defining a world.

Note btw that most science fiction is only cosmetically a building of alternative worlds. Much of the average stuff is simple relabeling. The better ones just acknowledge it openly.

An example of doing more is Dark Materials, where cosmetic similarities suggest a glitchy parallel universe that’s not quite like ours. Deepness in the Sky also pulls that off by constructing an uncanny valley of spider-beings whose story is told via overwrought human mapping.

I’ve been trying to systematize these intuitions by playing with situated archetypes that work across a whole class of worlds rather than inducing a specific one. Then you suggest the whole universe via “beat” frequencies that emerge in juxtaposition with a familiar universe

Getting back to history, a narrative is only a history if it’s not in an end-of-history identitarian consensus equilibrium. Good fiction has the feel of history.

It’s not enough that the world changes (plot) or characters grow individually or in mutuality. The world and characters must change together in, for want of a better term, Turing complete ways. Even a strange attractor or brownian motion won’t do.

It’s the entanglement that evolves irreversibly. And the characters don’t have to be “rich” in a literary sense for this. In fact that’s often a liability. Even 2d caricatures that are terrible by rules of “good” character dev can drive historic narrative if entangled right

This stuff is very hard. That’s why only a few cases have been solved analytically. For example evil twins from evil parallel universes who differ in social identity only by a goatee (van dyke actually...) is a surprisingly sophisticated device if you dig a bit into it.

“Good” and “evil” are shorthand codes/world-hashes for 2 different narrative equilibria, with a leak in either direction capable of restarting history. Good/evil is a property of the *entanglement* between the characters and home universes.

Importantly, social identity is *only* an address. That is why a trivial marker (facial hair) works to distinguish the two universes. It happens to be gendered but that’s unimportant. It could be a nongendered trait like long hair.

Interestingly, Marxist thought gets this whole idea in a degenerate way: “none of us is free until all of us are free” or “the oppressor requires liberation as much as the oppressed.” That’s a good special case of entangled history.

Where it fails is treating aspects of the context, like class, as immutable. A workers paradise isn’t classless. It’s a degenerate one-class, end-of-history society. To transcend class-structure, you need something with equal expressive power that preserves Turing-completeness.

## 33. Asking Questions

*April 30, 2019*

99% of the questions people ask in their 20s and early 30s are roughly the same seemingly “important” ones everybody has always asked at those ages. And 99% come up with roughly the same answers ranging from pretty dumb to reasonably smart regardless of effort.

The 1% different answers people come up with might make them somewhat more famous/rich, but are rarely different enough to change much beyond their own lives. The age-old questions are age old because the answers are in our collective diminishing marginal returns zone.

They are important, like air or water, but they aren’t wellsprings of meaning. How to make money, how to get laid, how politics works, who is good/bad, how to choose friends. You’ll spend 99% of your time on this stuff getting to useful and necessary but uninteresting places.

But if you trace back the most interesting, meaningful things people have done by 40s, you’ll usually find them asking a new *question* in 20s/early 30s nobody thought was worth asking. The questions are rarely deep/subtle. Many people consider them, but few do so seriously.

Even the most unimportant question can create a lot of meaning if it’s a new question and you’re one of few asking it at right age. This 1% of questions you ask should occupy 20% of your attention. The other 99% important-and-age-old questions deserve only 80% of  attention, why?

It’s because the 99% questions have been so milked to death by people asking them over 6000 years of recorded human history and writing down the answers, you can really triage the hell out of them. Most answers that have survived are “good enough”. Pick a lazy one and move on.

If you were a 34-year-old mediocre-intelligent guy and had to choose between spending 10 hours asking one of these questions in say 2009...

1. Is conservatism better/worse than liberalism?

2. Why is “The Office” so funny

3. How to fix economy?

Which one would you have chosen?

Like everybody else, I was asking 1 and 3, and got nowhere interesting. I didn’t do much worse or better than others on those (important) Qs.

What I did right was get bored enough with 1 and 3 to accept lazy answers and move on. Everything interesting in my life came out of Q2.

I’m sure others in their 40s have similar examples. My point is 25-40 is your most valuable, imaginative, intelligent and bold time of life, where your powers are at their peak, your life constraints are at their weakest, and your energy at its most boundless.

Don’t waste this period asking age-old questions everybody has been spending 99% of their youth asking through all history. Triage them, get to good enough, and find *new* questions that *few* people are asking. The more average you are, the more crucial this hack.

Exceptional geniuses might find unexpectedly high chunks of new marginal value in age-old actively-worked questions (age-old but abandoned/rarely asked questions are different, almost as good as new, but rarely as easy). You, statistically likely to be a mediocrity like me, won’t

And never let seeming triviality or unimportance stop you from investing demented amounts of energy into the answers. Even if everybody thinks you’re crazy. Novelty never wears its significance and hidden value on the cover.

## 34. Wealth/Success Monoculture in the US

*August 4, 2019*

Been reflecting on wealth and success (in conventional sense, which may involve some combination of wealth, fame, accomplishment, historic impact,  etc) lately.

Both are things I am not personally very motivated by. But they are not things I have a problem with either.

The US is a society that fetishizes wealth and success. It takes its societal organization cues almost entirely from the dynamics of wealth and success. Much can be explained by people either idolizing or demonizing wealth and success.

There’s no such thing as a centrist in the US when it comes to wealth/success. Believing that wealth/success are neither essentially good/evil, or virtuous/sinful, is not an option. You must construct a totalizing view of society as an extension of wealth/success views.

This is something I cannot grok deeply. I can only run American “wealth/success calculus” in emulation mode. I know many wealthy and/or successful people as well as many destitute and/or unsuccessful people. W/S has low correlation with whether I’ll find someone interesting.

To me wealthy or successful people are simply people who set out to solve for wealth or success in some sense, and succeed. Others who try, fail. It is what it is.

Their stories reveal very little about the nature of the human condition beyond the nature of wealth/success.

This is a thought many Americans seem incapable of thinking, but it is possible to live a life based on solving for other things: service, happiness, spirituality, adventure, thrills, family, etc. Most societies in history have had people solving for all of these.

What makes the US unique is the extent to which wealth/success monopolizes life scripts and contaminates even other scripts. You can’t just set out to be a nurse or a monk, you must set out to be a rich and successful nurse or monk. Even if that’s an incoherent thing to want.

Wealth/success monoculture has specific effects . On valorization side:

1. Horatio Algerism (assuming the wealth/success = wisdom, integrity, enlightenment

2. Fascination with half-assed Big Man theories

3. Crippling phobia of anything that even has a hint of socialism

On the demonization side:

1. Conspiracist fever dreams about the Bond-villainy of wealthy/successful

2. Socialist leanings oriented to a true north of ressentiment rather than compassion

3. Delusional recoding of mediocre prole lives as “wealthy and successful”

Second-order effects:

1. “I’m not a billionaire... yet” life scripts
2. A “waiting to arrive” life posture
3. Desperate insecurity around differentiation of individual identity
4. Distortion of justice into identity politics
5. Aestheticization over mitigation of poverty/misery

6. Treating of poverty or lack of success as a character flaw rather than just “it is what it is”

7. Systematic downplaying of the role of chance (even by the demonizers who overweight determinate structural oppression by the wealthy/successful in social explanations)

The structural/institutional effects are all over the place. 

Drug war, ridiculous incarceration rates, casting of any social cost problem as a “you’re trying to shill for/punish wealth/success”...

Signaling oriented consumerism, premium mediocrity...

The darkest effects are around things the US expends vast amounts of energy and capital in but barely talks about in anything like an appropriate proportion: healthcare, military adventurism, etc.

Why? Because attitudes to wealth/success imply very little of use on these issues

If you try to derive a sound view on healthcare, military adventures, or climate action from whether you love or hate billionaires or movie stars, you will end up with ridiculous cartoon views because these problems are fundamentally not even about wealth/success.

Note that obsessive focus on wealth/success is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. More individuals will be wealthy and/or successful as a fraction of the population and the society in aggregate will also be more wealthy and successful. But median is not the same as maximum.

You’ll have more billionaires and rockstars per capital and higher GDP and growth perhaps. But you’ll also be more cruel to your poor, sick, dying than societies with less individual/collective wealth/success. You’ll have bigger social costs, snowballing faster.

You will de facto criminalize lack of success or wealth. Your ability to solve for anything else (wisdom, compassion) will atrophy, because those are skills too.

Privilege literally means private law. That will become the only kind of law. Public law will become prison yard law.

Solving for wealth/success will look like breaking out of prison. If you’re not born to privilege, you’ll be born into increasingly prison-like situations, designed to contain, coerce, punish, tame. What I call breaking smart in more optimistic writing will become breaking out.

All countries have their share of transient problems, acute crises, chronic structural problems, and existential paradoxes. But the US probably has the most severe collective mental health problem among countries I think I grok. And the root cause is a wealth/success monoculture.

All this just makes me sad. 

The hard part is that America is highly attached to its wealth/success orientation as both a great national strength and the root of its exceptionalism narrative. 

It is hard to accept that your greatest strength can also be your greatest weakness.

Arrested development is *always* rooted in a sense of one’s strength. It is hard to move past this condition because it’s hard to notice when a strength stops being a strength and turns into a limiting self-perception.

I have no suggestions. America will either grow or die.

Btw, inequality, wealth concentration, cronyism, financialization of everything: all these are not “problems”. The are natural consequences of W/S values and enjoy basic moral sanction. If wealth+success = good, anything that favors it can at worst be inefficient, not bad.

The “problem” America has with these things is that they let “undeserving” people get wealthy and successful, and prevent greater peaks being reached by bigger Big Men, not because they make the poor more miserable or prisons more terrible.

America has more compassion for Bezos being harassed by Trump than people scammed by Trump University. More compassion for a well-funded startup being blocked from a market by a protectionist crony sector than people being actively hurt by the social costs of that sector.

## 35. Memory Genres

*September 23, 2019*

Here’s a spectrum of “memory” genres

1. Autobiography
2. Family history
3. Personal memoir
4. Subcultural history
5. Public life memoir
6. Participant history

Prediction: All of it is in trouble. Our cultural memory processes are breaking.

1. Autobiography is in trouble because it’s gone quantum. Living and narrating have gotten entangled live for anyone whose life might be of interest to others. You can’t just live an interesting life and then write it down. There’s a competing record of how you performed it live.

2. Family history is reality TV (it has been Kardashianized)

This has been kinda dead for a while anyway. Families have been a poor unit of broader cultural memory since hereditary nobility kinda became obsolete as a type of storage.

3. Personal memoir is suffering an odd fate — people are no longer sufficiently entangled in each other’s lives for long enough for that to be an interesting way to capture memories. It’s better to take a different slice, like the history of a neighborhood.

4. Subcultural history is probably the only gainer here, but average size of meaningful subcultures has been declining. As memory, it’s like replacing 10 1TB discs with 10k 1GB discs. The memories are being captured in a different frequency range. We’re high-pass filtering.

5. Public life memoirs are falling prey to fake news, weaponized revelations and whistleblowing, and a Rashomon effect. It’s unclear if live experiences are being captured in a way that allows for definitive accounts.

6. And finally, regular history is just kinda toast. Long story (ironic huh?)

The future of collective memory is multitemporal. Starting ~2000, increasingly, history will be seen to have a multiple personality disorder. No canonical history plus wistful counterfactuals. Just a superposition of non-consensus histories. Like a diffraction pattern.

This is the rough collective version of this individual-scale argument https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/05/30/the-age-of-diffraction/

This idea is probably much clearer in my head than it is to anyone else 🤔

Simplest example I can think of: accounts of Obama administration at all these levels will harmonize (including the hostile ones) in a way the equivalent Trump corpus won’t. It’s a fundamentally higher entropy story. Smaller ‘sum > parts’ narrative surplus to form grand narrative

Basically there won’t be a way to adopt a point of view that could call default or canonical. Only a bunch of alts. There will be nothing it is like to be a “spectator from nowhere” of history. If you try to write for this point of view there will be no readers for it.

All history will be revisionist history basically, with the role of default being taken over by a data ubiquity that tells no story, but undermines all of them.

The log level shall reign supreme

Collective memory is a form of identity creation. A way to create a point of view that can be adopted by others in the future. That’s how you engineer read/write/append access to it. This is now becoming untenable except as solipsism.

To quote myself: narratives tell archetypes how to evolve, archetypes tell narratives how to curve.

Narratives become indexical to self perpetuate by enabling identities with rewrite permission. 

Soon: all history is revisionist, all integration of memory is appropriation 😆

## 36. Mock Shocks and Rube Revelations

*October 4, 2019*

Looking for that Hangover 3 scene where they’re planning the break-in around a model of the target house and  Alan says “guys, you know this isn’t the house we have to break into right? Te real house is much bigger!”

A lot of supposed radical acts of truth strike me as like that

It’s the opposite of the mock shock affected by sophisticated cynics at revelations they consider not shocking st all, the “I’m shocked, SHOCKED” line that nobody uses these days in non-mocking ways.

Maybe opposite of Mock Shock is Rube Revelation?

When people act like they’re doing a brave act of radical truth telling, and are sincere about it, but nobody else is enlightened because they weren’t confused about it in the first place. The rube just projects their childish confusions onto a nonexistent common knowledge gap.

Rube revelation is to genuine heresy as bullshit is to truth. It’s not deliberate attempt to pass off common knowledge banalities as radical heresy, its an indifference to the distinction

Often cascades of rube revelation are started by something like a marginal common knowledge act. You take something 80% get (and know others get) that is too simple to mention and loudly belabor it at ELI5 level as radical insight till the 20% rubes get it.

This gets the rubes...

a) stoked on a supposed elite conspiracy to hide deep truths (which is really just not belaboring the obvious) 

b) rolling on a rube revelation cascade that’s 99% banality, 1% accidental nefarious-elite-machinations unmasking

There is something deeply disingenuous about this. Playing mock martyr to raise a mook army of newly enraged rubes reveling in faux-red-pill “enlightenment”.

Among other things this is where conspiracy theory epistemology starts.

The instigator of the Rube Enlightenment gets lionized as a liberating Paladin for the masses, newly armed and empowered with The Truth to act against evil elites. Now that they know the earth is flat and that q anon is The Truth, it’s all deep state x-files lies.

The massively energized rube detective force is now on the move ripping the mask off the face of naked elite oppression. For every pizzagate that turns out to line up with an Epstein scandal, a million libraries must be burned, a million flat-earth theories enshrined as knowledge

An age-old pattern: wannabe kings allying with peasants to take down the feudal gentry in the middle. It’s an example of what Jaron Lanier labeled Digital Maoism (in Edge, ironically). Hack the Noble Lies to install the People’s Truths forged in the fires of righteous rage.

Whether the People’s Truth finds expression in a new Rule of Woke Law or the Cleansing Commandments of Divine God-Emperor Zorgon the Heretic makes no difference. 

It’s a Book of Rube Revelations in either case. Fundamentally a stupid person’s idea of political wisdom.

This isn’t bothsidesing. It is signalsiding. Bothsidesing is acting like both sides of a false symmetry have equal validity, either because you’re dumb or because you’re disingenuous.

“the opposite of a great truth is also a great truth”). You really think we’re great-truthing?

If both sides are 90% noise, do the math. About 81% of the time both sides are being stupid, 9% of the time one side is right by accident and the other side is bothsidesing out of stupidity or malice.

About, 1% of the time it’s a great truth in contention. By accident probably.

Signal-siding is basically ignoring the stupid people, and continuing to actually think, even at the risk of perhaps missing the 1% great-truth debates.

Centrism is stupid or disingenuous because it acts like bothsidesing is meaningful 99% of the time instead of 1%.

Noise vs noise does not net to signal via mutual cancelation (heh!), it is noise squared. 

Signal is neither consensus or heresy by cosmic preference. Nor is it common sense or esoterically technical by preference, Signal is indifferent to self-important epistemic posturing.

The truth, such as it is, does not lie on the Rube Revelation spectrum at all. And smart elites who should know better but act like it does, raising mook armies and winking at the snowballing crackpottery and Maoist trials of their rivals among the elites are just seeking power.

If vast armies of enraged rubes rally around you, celebrating how you, the Rare Good Elite are absolutely tearing apart those awful Typical Bad Elites, you’re probably not catalyzing a Great Consciousness Raising among the masses. You’re cynically making a play for more power.

Basically, in this environment, anyone who attempts to shape opinions on a large mass-media scale, pwning millions of minds to coerce hundreds of millions of minds into ideological submission, is basically a bad person. It’s as clear a tell as pouring gasoline into a fire.

When you avoid the temptation to traffic in the Epistemic Status: Rube Revelation idea economy, you will find your audience hitting a low ceiling. Signal-siding in a noisy environment is like trying to have a conversation in a loud party with blaring music and drunken brawls.

Only the 5 people next to you and straining to understand you above the noise are signalsiding whatever you are saying. 

If the whole room hears you above the noise, music, and brawling, almost certainly you yelled something loud, stupid, and dangerous. Like “Fire!”

## 37. On Independent Research

*November 16, 2019*

I was briefly calling myself an independent researcher: somebody who self-funds spec R&D on their own ideas. In theory it’s something like indie-research : academic research :: blogging/self-publishing : traditional publishing.

But the idea doesn’t really work.

Unlike the market for general interest writing, the market for R&D is almost entirely institutional, and they don’t really “buy” indie R&D. It’s 99.9% crackpot inventors, 0.1% black swan stuff.

Most “research” indie consultants sell institutions is in the market-research class, not academic research

If I spent 6 months working on a new robot navigation algorithm or a study of government failure risk in Latin America or a deep study of some artist, nobody would buy it at a price that would pat for what it cost to do even in pure living costs terms.

You can at best target a research problem on a marketplace where someone has already declared a bounty, like say innocentive, nine sigma, etc (in which case they’re few and narrow). But that’s hardly independent. If you want to define and work on a problem you choose, it’s your $

Research = 

a) long time between having an idea and having something to show for it that even the most sympathetic fellow crackpot would appreciate (not even pat for, just get)

b) a >10:1 ratio of background invisible thinking in notes, dead-ends, eliminating options etc

With a blogpost, it’s like a week of effort at most from idea to mvp, and at most a 3:1 ratio of invisible to visible. That’s sustainable as a hobby/side thing. 

To do research-grade thinking you basically have to be independently wealthy and accept 90% deadweight losses

John Carmack announcing he was quitting oculus to do indie research on AGI finally made the stark equation clear. You need Carmack-level starting points (indie wealth, established R&D celebrity record) to go indie. That’s basically modern equivalent of old nobility.

That’s the real deal. Anyone below that threshold calling themselves an independent researcher is either talking about something like market research or trend research (which is really environmental intelligence work not R&D in the sense that interests me), deluded, or lying.

tldr: Get tenure, or get rich. Software has not eaten R&D, and won’t eat it anytime soon. Possible outliers like Satoshi (who may have been in an R&D institution or indie-wealthy in 2009 for all we know) notwithstanding.

Best-case outcome if neither applies: your idea has commercial potential and you can get a startup out of it. Which means the vast majority of ideas, both STEM and humanities, are out. Even I’m not optimist enough to think your R&D on 16rh century French poets can be a unicorn.

The reason software doesn’t eat R&D even though people think it should is that tools or open access to published lit/libraries, or free peer-reviewed publishing/presentation forums (if you want that) are only a tiny fraction of the cost for most ideas. The main host is time.

Even if the most expensive research tools like LHC or Hubble got as cheap as Arduinos, it wouldn’t help. That’s not the cost bottleneck. The bottleneck is researcher time. Even crappiest, cheapest conference paper I ever wrote took at least 6 months (~7k grad student salary then)

This isn’t cheap talk btw. I dropped 2k on a personal Matlab license after I went indie and kept it current for years, and went through dozens of false starts working on various ideas. Couldn’t find the time to develop any of them to even bad-conference-paper level.

Note: peer-reviewed publishing or patents just as depth cal9bration. I wouldn’t necessarily publish in such forms since I don’t think those institutional processes have ever added much to my work. Nor into them tbf, in the peer reviewing I’ve done. But I’d aim for that depth.

Note #2: I enjoy proper research, but wasn’t a great talent even at my peak and am now likely at 60%. So in a way this is an okay market outcome. If I were wealthy I might do self-indulgent mediocre research for the rest of my life, but no reason you should pay for it.

Note #3

Learning projects to prepare to go deep on a subject are not research even if it feels like it

Reading published literature and blogging a few derivative observations is not research

Critiquing/finding flaws in published papers is indie peer-review, not research

I find that autodidacts who haven’t experienced institutional R&D environments have a self-congratulatory low threshold for what they count as research. It’s a bit like vanity publishing or fan fiction. This mismatch doesn’t exist as much in indie art, consulting, game dev etc

I’m on a year-long fellowship right now, and this is partly what has made me admit the conceit in the “indie researcher” self-label. I’m doing this sort of thinking for the first time since ~2006 or so (the year I last submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed journal). https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/1195806039708520448

It’s also reminding me how much I enjoy doing the real thing. It’s like a year long vacation back to my own past.

Ironically, most modern tenured faculty don’t get to do much R&D either, at least in STEM. They’re too busy fund-raising. They’re more like angel investors and board advisors to grad students and postdocs. Humanities and social sciences may perhaps be better, I don’t know.

If you’re thinking kickstarter-like funding mechanisms, forget it. You’ll be asking for 10x as much money as typical artistic or startuppy projects, have no natural rewards to hand out, and a far lower likelihood of success.

A good public example: Breaking Smart S2 was a medium-depth research project I thought I could sustain on my own (a16z supported S1). I gave up looking for funding after a couple of half-hearted pitches to orgs I thought might be a fit for the topic.

The topic I wanted to research, and got about 1/3 the way through, was institution building in the Great Weirding. It’s the sort of thing that’s not a natural fit for any corporate funding source.

Current plan is to package and flush out what I have so far as a sort of “Christmas Special” about 1/5 the scope/ambition of S1.

A more basic problem with kickstarter type ideas is that anyone good at creating the buzz and hype for that is almost by definition going to be bad at R&D and vice versa. Content mismatch aside.

Writing grant proposals to satisfy a few bureaucrats is already enough of a mismatch to research personalities. Crowd-pleasing requires 10x that painful mismatch.

List of actually credible indie researchers

1. Stephen Wolfram (math/complexity/computation)
2. Jeff Hawkins (neuroscience)
3. John Carnack (AGI)

Notice something, besides the fact they’re smart and have the right subject-matter prep?

They got rich first 🙂

Don’t mean to be a downer. There’s possibly imaginative models that could work in indie mode that I simply haven’t thought of.

Many things get called “research” and a lot of ego-sensitivity gets attached to it. I think of it mainly in terms of (high risk of no valuable output)*(high ratio of invisible to visible output)*(high time demands). Let me try to pseudo-quantify this and take the ego element out:

1. Intelligence briefs
2. Gartneresque research
3. Investigative journalism
3. Market research
4. Broad societal trend research
5. Data-heavy trend research, pure math
6. Tech futures, humanities
7.  S/W tech, social science
8. Generic STEM
9. Big science
10. Paradigm shifts

This scale isn’t commentary on the intelligence, creativity, or imagination of the people who do such work. Higher on the scale is simply riskier, more time-consuming, and requires more backend work, even holding the human factor constant

One thing I probably could do is raise funding for a small research institution/lab working on problems in the 6-8 range. Maybe 4-5 staff. The thing is I don’t want to run a research org, which is an entirely different interest/ambition than doing research. It takes a COO type.

Strange-looping in a secondary meta thread I did later. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195937380210921472

## 38. On Independent Research II

*November 17, 2019*

Thinking about my thread this morning on why independent research is hard, and what it would take to make it possible, and whether it’s within the reach of private investors who ALL complain endlessly about how they have far too much capital and don’t know where to put it. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195789557465153536

On one extreme you can think UBI, which is roughly ~ early grad student level $. 

On the other extreme, you could think of early career faculty grants.

An NSF CAREER grant is 100k/year for 5 yrs, and in 2018, about 150 million was disbursed or about 300.

A subset of ~20 get PECASE awards which push up the 100k to 500k/yr, sp that’s another 40 million. This 190 million basically supports 300 new faculty every year which I think is approximately ALL new faculty in say the top 25-30 universities.

At grad student stipend level, you’re talking about a quarter that. 25k/year. So you could support about 1200 grad student level researchers for the same amount. So $19- million gets you somewhere between 300 to 1200 bets on independent researchers. Now who can afford that?

Let’s look at Silicon Valley.  Last I checked, Series A, B, C, and D rounds are ~10 million, 20mm, 50mm, 100mm. Might be off by a bit.

So... doubling research capacity of entire university system = 20 As, 10 Bs, 4 Cs, or 2 Ds.

Entirely within the capacity of SV capital market

I’m making this arithmetic comparison because SV investors sometimes act like basic research is entirely out of their reach and all they can do is draft off of output of big government R&D programs running over decades. This is just not true anymore.

SV people tend to be free market ideologues, yet their free market idealism mysteriously vanishes when talking about this stuff. SoftBank alone could fund something like this probably.

And indie research would dispense with indirect cost support (~50% overhead charge that research universities typically charge agencies to pay for brick-and-mortar infrastructure, a big innovation in its time, due to Vannevar Bush).

Basically there’s a bullshit R&D funnel argument that people trot out to explain slowing of new business formation and general innovation stagnation/falling business dynamism (similar to the one around diversity in tech hiring).

The research university model worked well for about 60 years after WW2. It supplied both the talent and the IP feedstock (not just STEM, humanities/liberal arts as well) to drive American business growth an leadership. Z

Basically free in-kind money for the innovation economy.

Now that model is struggling, I have to wonder why huge capital stocks created from that legacy investment aren’t being plowed back into the head of the funnel. 

Possibly SV has gotten used to easy private wealth building off of publicly funded feedstock.

I think the R&D loop can be closed with tech wealth and investment capital. Universities can be unbundled. There’s no good reason to keep teaching, research, and service in the same costly brick and mortar bundle anymore.

I bet every top 5 VC,  PE, and Big Tech firm could each sustain 20% NSF CAREER type indie research network, 3x-ing total R&D bandwidth of the US. 

With expectations of open source/license output. Restock the commons without need for big 60s/70s style government programs.

I’d revamp publishing, peer review models, etc, as well, since the model that exists is failing even for university research (hence reproducibility crisis, impact factor gaming, purely cronyism predatory journal empires etc) but that’s a secondary mechanism design problem.

Income-share education models already exist and offer a competitive alternative to the teaching function of universities and get out of the unsustainable student debt balloon. 

R&D can be unbundled too.

What’s the alternative? The innovation economy finally kills the dying golden goose for the last few golden eggs, and enters a late stage fraud economy competing with NIMBY grifters in decaying urban cores. Stockbuybackitis infects SV too. The music stops.

In this picture the traditional university doesn’t get disrupted so much as have its role refactored into a sort of infrastructure cloud provisioning role. 

I’d expect much of this sort of thing to happen in university ecosystems actually.

There’s probably a way this solves the adjunct crisis too, but I’ll leave that for another day (it’s an overlapping population but not coextensive with indie research target population... maybe 30% overlap)

Personally I’m aged out of directly benefiting from this kind of infrastructure and am not missionary enough to try and lead an effort to make it happen for others.

Happy to play wingman to anyone with the hustle and network to try though. I’ve thought this through a lot 🙂

Would have been nice to have this option in 2006 though, when my choices were: second postdoc, govt lab, industry, a sketchy faculty position offer I didn’t like, and SBIR grinding. I created blogger-consultant option for myself ~2007 and that worked well for me but doesn’t scale

* SBIR and STTR, for those unfamiliar with it, is a rather sorry-ass federal small business innovation grants program that in theory should sustain indie research, but in practice ends up subsidizing military-industry complex subcontracting layer

My own future ambitions beyond indie writing and publishing are pretty modest, so I can self-fund most things I care to research on the margins of non-research stuff and don’t need anyone besides me to care about outcomes. No desire to shoot for John Carmack level goals.

I was very lucky btw, to have so many options, and a generally cheerful and positive mindset exiting academia, feeling good about myself and my choices. The university system traumatizes and destroys 4-5 people for every 1 it shapes positively. It’s ugly out there.

Clarification: I only considered CAREER grants rather than the vastly larger total funding pie because bootstrapping the”startup” phase is the hardest part of research. My speculative assumption is that if that’s solved, enough will succeed that larger pie will emerge organically https://twitter.com/Danderso13/status/1196040865170546688

Several people seem to be misunderstanding this part of my argument. The CAREER grant is a good calibration point even though it’s only a tiny fraction, because it’s what creates new research CAPACITY in the university system out of new PhD ranks. That’s what I’d like to see 3xed

I seem to have accidentally joined a mini-wave of commentary on indie research. Here is @nayafia describing her experience, a kind of edge case between the sort of indie research I’m talking about and existing institutional margins. https://nadiaeghbal.com/phd

And here’s a piece by James Gallagher https://t.co/pcXzjxmUWX

Here’s John Carmack’s announcement which is what got me tweeting. Not sure what gotbthe others thinking about this right now. https://m.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2547632585471243&id=100006735798590

Aside: a few seem to be reading this thread as a proposal for a disruptive attack on the university research system rather than speculations for a parallel system for a potential indie research world. But yes, it could potentially lead to competition, which would be a good thing.

It’s a ritual in the university world to whine about how research funding is under threat. But from the outside, people would correctly conclude that the system has near-monopolistic access to a vast public funding budget. And my proposal doesn’t even envision touching that.

If the university research world is concerned about competition from a parallel independent research world catalyzed by private funding and alternate norms, one that currently has vanishingly tiny funding (mostly self-funding) compared to their world, you have to wonder: why?

I wonder what would happen if I invited people to send me 1-page proposals in a pro-forma for indie mini-CAREER grants and just threw up a page linking to all of them, then promoting that page. I bet I could match at least a few proposals to private funding sources 🤔

## 39. Threadapalooza 100 political opinions thread

*December 13, 2019*

Candid political opinions thread. One per like. Limit 100.

The entire case for socialism in 2019 rests on AOC dance video

UBI is a bad idea

The case for urban densification is much weaker than proponents think

Warren will beat Sanders and Biden and then Trump will beat Warren

Green New Deal is a total train wreck that does not deserve to be entertained as a serious proposal

Greta Thurnberg is actually interesting

Citizens of China are complicit in the actions of the CPP despite it not being a democracy

Bougainville island deserves independence from Papua New Guinea because they wear great hats

The Citizenship Amendment Bill in India is the most cynical political act of 2019

China’s presence in Africa is not colonialism, and African nations know what they are doing in participating

One Belt, One Road is a fragile initiative and will fail to meet Chinese objectives

Gonna start numbering.

12.  Aung San Suu Kyi’s career is proof that the Nobel Peace Prize is purely expedient virtue signaling by the West to bolster legitimacy of its shaky claim to global moral leadership. It should be shut down, and endowment returned as a dividend to Swedes.

13.  The correct response to all things GOP and Trump is “ok boomer”, obstruction, and running out their clock. They are beyond redemption.

14. Flight 93/Michael Anton justification for supporting Trump is stupid and people who bought it were and are delusional

15. Climate change is real

16. Vaccines are good

17. Identity tribes are not meaningful units of natural selection and people who believe they are are dumb

18. Gangsterism is a better basis for politics than purist ideology

19. “People of color” is a terrible term and I refuse to use it

20.  The internet has been healthier for politics than TV and radio

21. San Francisco is not worth fixing and should be allowed to suffer the consequences of being itself by being systematically abandoned

22. High inequality is not a cosmically righteous outcome of enlightened market economics and innovation-fueled growth and people who believe that merely lack the theological imagination to worship something more interesting than financial wealth

23. Everybody should give me money

24. Seattle is the best-run major US city

25. Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be easy and legal

26. The Great Awokening has turned cancerous and should be abandoned

27. Classical liberalism is a clueless position and people espousing it should be ignored and kept away from anything important

28. The Electoral College is not a fundamental problem. Just a delaying ofvthe inevitable.

29.  Plastic is good

30. Cat people make for better political leaders but dog people are more electable

31. Singapore is a fun place to visit but a terrible model polity no matter what your ideology

32. Political Islam is an overblown threat because it does 2x damage to itself in its territorial dar-al-islam core for every 1x damage it attempts to inflict on dar-al-harb, making it a self-limiting problem that will decline with the oil economy

33. Latin America is politically the most ridiculous continent

34. Anyone pretending to have more than 3 real political opinions is making shit up for lulz or delusionally self-important because politics is too hard to develop more than 3 real opinions in a lifetime

35. Liberal democracy is still the best system of politics

36. Cosmopolitanism is more enlightened than nationalism

37. China under the CPP is not a credible ideological competitor to the West outside of China and will never enjoy the kind of soft power the US-led West once did, or even the level that South Korea enjoys today

38. Russia is not a coherent political actor but a geopolitical shitposter

Hitting pause for tonight. Will drive towards 100 in a couple more session over the next week.

39. Being basic and being based are actually the same thing if you squint a bit

40. The Nehru-Gandhi family should be ashamed of itself, take partial responsibility for turning the BJP into an unchecked force, and withdraw from public life.

41. The EU was a good idea and an important and brave experiment, whatever its ultimate fate

42. Georgism is a good idea that Homo sapiens is not an enlightened enough species to put into practice

43. Politics is essentially a digital computer (as in support for people or policies is fundamentally 0/1), public political debate is meaningless, nuance kills agency, and the only way to influence it is to prepare new 0/1 options in private settings

44. Boris Johnson is smarter than Donald Trump

45. If, after thoughtful consideration, you still think a nation can be meaningfully analogized to a household, you're an authoritarian

46. All interesting politics now takes place in groups <30 in size. Above that scale is all zombie egregores.

47. QE is the monetarist equivalent of MAGA

48.  States/provinces are the worst political unit, worse than both cities and nations

49. All ideologies are the products of people resentful about either being unable to get into, or out of, dying cushy institutions, not values or ideals

50. Politics in the EU is more primitive than in the US or Asia

51. Climate change is not solvable through politics and will fall to industry

52. There will be both left and right Neo-Puritanism on the national stage by 2035 and it will be tedious and awful

53. All humor is reactionary and if you want to retain the right to laugh, the best thing you can do is pick the best era to be reactionary about, which is the 1980s

54. Individualism is a cancer in the social organism that deserves to win

55. Solidarity is a stupid tactic in a social media era because it makes you a dumber actor than algorithms acting on high-visibility social graph

56. All good politics today starts with breaking ranks and being a scab

57.  Entryism is a stupid person’s idea of disruption

58. Everybody should be able to vote in every election anywhere in the world, with their vote weighted in inverse proportion to their distance from the jurisdiction of the political office in question

59. The externalities of the politics of localism at any scale are worse than the externalities of economic activity at a comparable scale

60. Modern collectivism is just 20th political consumerism, not a manifestation of some ineffable essential social nature of Homo sapiens. It has more in common with shopping than primate ethology.

61. Other people should have children

62. The most deeply subversive political skill is learning to see what’s real about other people, 1 at a time, not what’s fake about them, 1000 at a time. 

Learning to see the fakeness at scale wins you elections, learning to see unscalable realness wins you history

63. You can win elections and lose history, and vice versa, or win both, or lose both. Winning history matters much more than winning elections.

64. Politics is always a choice between competing bets on the past masquerading as bets on the future, and you should bet on the weakest such bet

65. Star Trek is the best political universe but most humans are either too smart or too stupid to live in it. Mostly the latter.

66. The global political future is headed for Fireflyverse: globalized, aestheticized, romanticized, sanitized, sentimentalized post-civil-war American south with Chinese characteristics. Where stupid people will be sustainably miserable.

67. The best politics aims for government by the mediocre, of the mediocre, for the mediocre

Okay good place to hit pause. Act 3 within the next week. Suggestions for topics I haven’t yet touched welcome.

68. Big-tent-leftist-causes approach to climate are a bad idea both pragmatically and ideologically. It's a surgical cause.

[Gonna slow-walk my own thread as a sort of threadapalooza median-pace-setting mechanism, and and add an opinion for every dozen or so I see float by]

69. Horseshoe theory is only applicable to hedgehogs and it is the primary hedgehog political derangement disease

70. Politics is unduly influenced by those with the time/energy to call their representatives and/or show up for town halls and things. It is 80% You're Not Yelping and only 20% Doing Noble Civic Duty.*

* Hot take based on video clips on twitter

71. Dissensus is better than consensus, other things being equal

72. The global diffusion of regional cuisines and ingredients has been the biggest driver of goodwill, harmony, and collective mental health on the planet and aggressive purist evangelism of any diet aimed at “optimizing” nutrition for health alone is anti-humanist sedition

73. The impeachment does not matter

74. There should be no income taxes. Only property, sales, capital gains, exim, and octroi taxes.

75. Global open borders should be asymptotically approached via the fastest pragmatic means available to politics

76. Monarchism is bad

77. Animals that can feel pain should be represented by legitimized advocates within the political process charged with considering their quality of life

78. Capital punishment should be stopped

79. The world would be a much healthier place if there were habitable ungoverned regions set aside by international agreement as exile spaces for anyone to go to

80. Libertarian paternalism (aka Sunstein/Thaler Nudge models) is a bad idea in and of itself even if it doesn’t degenerate into basic paternalism

81. Every significant tech era retires a few ideologies and enables a few new ones. The ones being retired by software eating the world are: socialism, classical liberalism, eurocentrism, and identitarianism, and each is the core of a reactionary movement right now

82. No "new" ideology currently has a fully established claim to a seat at the big table as a new political actor, despite frantic posturing to pretend otherwise.

83. The top 6 ground-level phenomenology trends driving the new politics are: climate change/energy transitions, housing in metro areas globally, aging and falling birth rates in west, migration, inequality and healthcare. Your opinions on these 5 things ARE your ideology.

84. Asia (beyond just China) has forked off. There are now two competing Grand Narratives in the world.

85. The financial/investment world has no clue what's going on, is afraid of everything, and has been largely reduced to One Weird Trick: financialization. The One Weird Trick is increasingly being executed by minds that have already retreated to New Zealand bunkers

86. Neither the 1% nor the under-the-API nouveau-poor (bottom 60%?) can invent the future that needs inventing now. It's up to the mediocre-normie middle class. It's a race between forces shrinking this class, and imaginative political actions emerging from this class.

87. LOTR is about 2 political events: Tom Bombadil being disinterested in the ring, and Gandalf v. Balrog battle which happens offstage. The rest of the plot (Mordor v. Frodo's Army) is noise and fury signifying nothing. 

Yes this is a metaphor.

88. All pure, radically decentralized political ideologies are bs because humans want maximally intimate belongingness so badly that they'll max out the technically possible scale of centralized organization every era. If a 7.5b hive mind were possible, 6.5b would sign up.

89. I'd be in the 1b that would refuse to sign up for said hive mind in 88. It sounds awful, but then most humans are awful and would choose that state.

90. Most bad politics arises out of bad literary tastes, as in enjoying stories about stereotypes. Good politics arises out of pattern matching archetypes while they still have "alpha" (predictive power) with a tasteful literary sensibility

91. Stereotypes are real, and there is always a subset of every stereotyped population that actually willingly conforms to that stereotype, performing it with an aggressive deadness. These dead player zombies are the core of all politics. All politics is about seeing dead people.

92. All Straussians are wrong about almost everything just by virtue of being Straussian and being unable to come to terms with the central (heh!) role of mediocrity in the human condition. Their Noble Lies are mainly to themselves.

93. Zizek is correct. The Normie ideology is cynicism, and conversely, all ideology turns into cynicism by the time it goes normie. This is why Noble Lie political philosophy is bs because there is no unawakened consciousness laboring under from it. http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/cynzizek.html

## 40. Animals, Agency, and Accountability

*February 14, 2020*

Been thinking a lot about animal trials in medieval europe and how we've not just reversed the idea of animal criminal culpability, but extended it to certain classes of humans. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_trial

Anybody who gets away with a "look what you made me do!" defense for their actions is asking to be basically extended the protection of presumption of animal non-culpability for their actions. I hear it as "I'm an animal and I cannot be held responsible for my actions"

People on the right tend to make such arguments on their own behalf (both rich and poor... "look what the liberals made us do"). People on the left tend to make them on behalf of others less fortunate who may or may not appreciate the animal-status patronizing.

One reason I'm thinking about this is that now that we've stopped bothering about explanations for why Trump rose to power and to some extend assumed that his 2nd term is the null hypothesis, narrative energies are being diverted to judgment rather than explanation.

The explanation part for his rise has defaulted to the animal level. His supporters are not responsible for voting him into office, and he's not responsible for what he's done there so far. The judgment part for ongoing behaviors has become curiously suspended altogether.

It's an interesting symmetry break. Both sides agree on this for once: liberals have agency, conservatives don't. Liberals are governed by evil values and do evil things. Conservatives just respond as they must according to the natural order of spiritual karmic law.

So the Discourse is 100% about judgment of the left. In this narrative, the impeachment trial is not-even-wrong theater, like a medieval animal trial based on poorly scoped ideas about who has moral culpability.

Only the question of "How Woke caused the Weirding with malice aforethought" is judgment worthy. The guilty verdict for 100% of the blame is already in. Only sentencing remains. Other parties are not so much blameless as ontologically unfit to stand trial as humans with agency.

This is really surreal. A shit ton is going wrong in all parts of the world, on all sorts of fronts (climate, finance, war, tech). But the only people being morally held to account for any of it is those subscribing to woke ideologies.

An alien would be justified in concluding that homo sapiens is really 2 species. Morally culpable homo sapiens wokus, and morally non-culpable homo sapiens tradus.

As a thought experiment, what if actual condition is the reverse: everybody *except* the wokies has moral culpability. They've had their brains rotted by some sort of vague intersectional mind virus written in COBOL. Ignore and isolate them. This actually rings more true to me

On the one side, I hear sophomore wokies spouting robotic gobbledygook I can barely parse, and am not sure they can either.

On the other, I hear crystal clear messages of overt cruelty, hostility, vengefulness etc. 

Which of the 2 is more responsible for their thoughts/words?

Not going anywhere in particular with this line of thought. I don't think blame and judgment subplots of narrativizing history are either futile or the whole story. Holding people morally accountable for things that are happening is one part of how humans process what to do next.

To the extent that the blame/judgment subplot has gotten itself into a weird narrative bind where only a tiny subset are subject to it, the narrative mechanism has broken, and either needs to be fixed, or other parts of the mechanism need to pick up the slack.

I think I know why we're in this condition. The thing is, ideologies only accept accountability for loci of agency they see as legitimate, so everything that happens at other loci is the fault of people who see agency there as legitimate.

ie if your philosophy only recognizes the legitimacy of individual agency in personal life, then collective failures are obviously the fault of collectivists.

Usually, this wonderful leap of logic involves attributing god-like correct functioning and infallibility to an emergent mechanism at the higher levels which would work great if only humans would cede all agency to the Higher Power at that level. Markets, gods, take your pick.

I'm blameless and doing everything right wherever I'm responsible for my actions.

There exists a higher power that *would* do everything right if only we'd let it.

Some evil people don't let it. They're to blame for everything wrong at other levels.

Thinking about how to get past this condition. I have no good ideas at present, but I'm thinking a first design commitment is to take agency abdicators at their word. If they want animal levels of non-culpability, even if it sounds insulting to me, let them claim it. Move on.

The implication is that I wouldn't attempt to argue with them anymore than I would attempt to argue with my cat. My cat does his cat-tricks to try to manipulate me, I do my human-tricks to prevail. Hard to say this in non-pejorative way... but I'm very nice to animals.

Pseudospeciation is an ugly tribalist move to dehumanize the outgroup. But what do you do when individuals and groups start doing it to themselves to reap the benefits of animal non-culpability? Call it auto-pseudospeciation?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudospeciation

Not sure what the reasonable test for acting human is. I think it means owning your actions and all consequences, right up to boundary of where others freedom of action begins. Nobody "makes" anybody else do anything past age 5. But if you insist I made you do something, so be it

I'm trying to reduce this thread to a single paradox contradiction. I think it's something like: what do you do when you want to attribute more moral agency to someone than they'll acknowledge having themselves?

I'm reminded of the oddest conversation about vegetarianism I've had, with an Egyptian. Most meat eaters accept moral agency/culpability that might be involved in choosing to eat meat. But this guy's response was "but the Koran tells us to eat everything!"

Cracked me up.

I'm vegetarian leaning vegan where/when I can, but not evangelical about it, and don't try to convert others. Meat eaters who raise the topic with me  accept their agency in choosing to eat meat 99% of the time. 

Denying such agency via appeal to religious duty is...odd

People who accept their moral agency are generally capable of surprising you. Sufficient, but not necessary condition. This includes you being able to surprise yourself. If you cannot surprise yourself you have an animal sense of yourself.

Why is surprisability key here?

The Internet of Beefs, IoB, is people who can’t be surprised either by themselves or by others. Tell: if you can mock somebody you’re predicting them. If you’re still mad at them it’s because they’re not accepting culpability where you want them to.

This means even where you and I agree that something has gone wrong rather than as designed by somebody, nobody is accepting responsibility. It’s a “who owns this externality” argument.

If the only consequences of your actions that you own are predictable ones, and all externalities are attributable to other people’s (predictable and mockable) misguided actions, are you really acknowledging any agency at all?

Real agency results in 2 kinds of surprise

1. Unexpected material consequences
2. Unexpected responses from others with agency

You’re not accepting your own humanity and attendant material and moral agency if you don’t act in ways that generate BOTH kinds of surprise.

If no unintended consequences are ever the result of what you chose to do, you are viewing your agency like an animal’s.

If people never respond to you in surprising ways it means something a bit more complex.

It is some combination of:

a) you’re only pushing their animal buttons
b) they’re like you, and only have animal buttons
c) you’ve blinded yourself to their surprising responses

IoB is b vs b.

## 41. The Economics of Dignity

*February 14, 2020*

When you "pull yourself together" you pull yourself together to approximate a consensus definition of human. For eg. stand up straight or slouch depending on what's fashionable right then. That definition evolves over time.

The idea of "respecting the dignity of humans" is really trying to define basic human rights in a way that allow anybody to "pull themselves together" to the current local consensus definition at reasonable cost.

The idea that having to crawl on all fours in front of an old-fashioned monarch is dehumanizing is relative to a modern definition of human. Back then, it was probably the case that "pulling yourself together" in the king's court meant crawling on all fours in a particular way

Slouching was indeed the fashionable posture at one point. https://www.vogue.com/article/history-fashion-posture-balenciaga-models 

https://twitter.com/VirajSinha/status/1228449375967420417

arguing for human rights and dignity becomes much more complex when you want to avoid assuming a particular definition of 'human' but still capture humane ideas about how to treat people in the concept

A good part of the project of civilization is to construct and sustain a notion of the human that creates a meaningful separation from other animals. And to a surprising degree, this is defined in terms of keeping one's composure... as in the composed performance of "humans"

This might seem arbitrary. One might cynically say that in these terms, human rights become defined as "the right to act" in a certain theatrical way. Except those performances are how we transact social sustenance with each other. 

Hello, how are you, pleased to meet you.

One of the problems with labor economics is that it is structurally blind to the evolving invisible notion of dignity that we must maintain to feel human and that life is worth living.

I recall an episode of shark tank or something where mark cuban refused to invest in someone because she refused to play air guitar for him. I forget the context.

My reading of the incident was that the woman was anchored on a particular notion of performed (but not performative) dignity that would have been debased by that kind of behavior among strangers.

Cuban was unwittingly asking her to debase herself by her idea of dignity for no good reason. He seemed confused by her refusal because by his notion of dignity, it would have been a low-cost way to land an investment, because it wouldn't have bothered him to do it

Now there's a pragmatic thing here... he could, as an investor, be thinking, "you came on a tv show for investment, and if you're not willing to debase yourself a bit for the cameras, how will you get through the endless humiliation of being an entrepreneurial success"

As I argued in the economics of pricelessness, it is axiomatic in the saints-and-traders dialectic that traders *expect* to trade dignity for profit. That's almost the whole definition of the commerce ethos posture in Jane Jacobs sense https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/08/12/the-economics-of-pricelessness/

Now this brings up an interesting question. Sure you should have the right to debase yourself in others' eyes as much as you like in pursuit of personal profit. But can/should you use any power you have to force *others* to debase themselves by *their* definition of dignity?

This is pretty much the definition of humiliation. In the mild case, I adopt a conservative posture: never knowingly ask anyone to compromise their personal sense of dignity. This is the reason the opening joke in the EoP post works.

It is doubly humiliating because first the rich guy used the power of money to undermine the woman's sense of her own dignity, then took away the incentive for the undermining. That's pure sadism. Dehumanizing someone because you can.

In a way, humiliation is the currency of the labor economy. A purely dignity-respecting economy wouldn't work. It wouldn't be liquid enough. The way you get it moving is to allow *unknowing* assaults on dignity.

Original version of joke in EoP
--
Man: will you sleep with me for $1 million?
Woman: Okay
Man: will you sleep with me for $5?
Woman: WHAT! What kind of woman do you take me for?
Man: we’ve already established what kind of woman you are. Now we’re just haggling over the price.

Dignity respecting  kinda non-joke (modulo your absolute moral view of prostitution)
--
Man: will you sleep with me for $500?
Woman: WHAT! Do I look like a hooker to you?
Man: My apologies, in my country prostitution is legal, and I don't yet understand dress norms here

The boundary of the labor economy is a noise band around common knowledge of the local ecosystem of "dignities". It moves slowly towards "more corrupted" by traditionalist scopes

In an increasingly connected, globalized, remote transactions world, it is becoming harder and harder to price in the cost of navigating the fuzzy boundary of "dignity". Distant remote corporations can unknowingly assault local dignities for decades, with the resentment building

The dissonance shows up in the gap between performed and felt dignity. This is why the waiter may smile at you, but spit in your food. He's performing dignity in a way that allows him to go on living because he can't overtly challenge the expectations.

So a good question for economists to consider is: can price-based mechanisms price dignity in a way that lowers the rate of waiters spitting in your food?

And note that surveillance is not the answer, since people forced to perform a debilitating and dehumanizing level of dignity they are powerless to resist will always find some unobservable space to indulge in compensatory behaviors.

If the waiter can't spit in the food because there are now cameras in the kitchen, he will key the car of patrons in the parking lot. If you put cameras there he will start anon-trolling members of the patron class online. Etc. etc. It's a dignity arms race.

It's also the human face of the perfect information problem faced by markets. The challenge is to put a price on hostile behaviors practiced in darkness by those forced to perform in humiliating ways just to survive.

Pricing in invisible restorative behaviors sentient agents practice to maintain themselves in a state they consider "dignified human" while living visibly under conditions that constitute a continuous assault on their idea of dignity.

Even perfect surveillance doesn't solve the problem. In that case, the rage and resentment just builds up invisibly in the psyche, until it explodes, either in isolation (mass shootings say), or via collective aggression.

In a way, this is *the* central problem of our times, for both technology and economics. Creating a properly priced dignity market that can seek equilibrium without periodically exploding via beserking or rioting or other kinds of humiliation-revenge/dignity-balancing.

The problem isn't, and never was, technology taking away jobs. The problem is, and has always been, economies taking assaulting dignities.

Not sure how to approach solving the problem, but a good starting point is, if you have to have a policy that your employees have to act nice in certain ways beyond the natural niceness levels of random pairs of humans, you're creating an invisible dignity deficit

That, or you're somehow hiring exactly the wrong people. Like selecting the naturally rudest sorts of people for waiter jobs. Which is... not smart. Selecting for natural cheery/nice temperament otoh is fine. But demanding 15 pieces of flair means you're doing dignitynomics wrong

And if otoh, your mix of incentives draws only the desperate who will comply with any kind of absurdly dignity assaulting policy, it means you're a predatory business. You're arbitraging baseline levels of misery/desperation and externalizing the costs.

A much more explicit example of this is if your employees have to seek social welfare like food stamps to make ends meet in your full-time job. That's a straight-up subsidy you're taking advantage of. The state keeps 'em breathing, you suck out what life remains in them.

There's an argument to be made here that this is the main problem with inequality. It is a condition stabilized by an accumulating dignity deficit problem that will blow up in our faces at some point and destroy wealth.

Now of course, there is such a thing as a reasonable expectation of respect for dignity that can get very unreasonable indeed. Here the US actually has good priors: nobody is any better or worse than anyone else.

Explicitly classist societies like India have historically had dignity levels and you only have a right to the dignity default of your level. This creates a sclerotic, compartmentalized economy, effectively regulated by dignity boundaries. Economies of scale are lost.

But a reasonable response here is to let the market handle it. You can choose whatever dignity ideal you like, and jobs will be designed not to knowingly assault or drain your dignity. By not demanding pieces of flair etc.

But you don't have the right to be employed at your chosen arbitrary dignity level far out of the 3-sigma bounds of humanity. You only have the right not to have it callously assaulted by work that is structurally blind to the fact that you are maintaining a dignity state at all.

I suppose I should write this up as a sequel to my economics of pricelessness post. Economics of Dignity. I'm guessing this will languish on twitter for a year, then in a draft for another year, before I finally write it long after it could be useful.

## 42. Quality Control vs. Quality Selection

*February 19, 2020*

Shifting from quality as a yield fraction of quantity (the high-grading intrinsic approach to quality) to quality as a controllable process outcome (six sigma) is a total valley of death. Creative work should be defined as that which cannot survive the transition.

To apply control control as opposed to quality selection (high grading) you need a formula to apply it to. When you don’t have one, but energy is falling faster than yield rate is rising, it is very tempting to invent one to keep absolute yields constant to pay the bills.

This is the moment of stall crisis for the process. To recover, you have to counter-intuitively five rather than climb. Ie lower the selection threshold for “high grade”. In a way this is the opposite of forcing a formula and trying to faux-optimize (fauxtimize?) it.

Really hard to do because every instinct and cultivated taste will protest. You’re burning reputational capital (altitude) to get higher yield rate (velocity) to recover from the stall (critically low absolute yield)

Generally this also means reorienting what you’re solving for. Lowering quality without opening up objectives (changing flight plan = innovation) means the lowered quality is a deadweight loss.

This is probably a manifestation of the bias-variance tradeoff in disguise, but I’m feeling too lazy to work out how to connect the dots https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias–variance_tradeoff

You’re done as a live player the day you’re not willing to put out something shoddy by *your* standards. Consistent output and a consciously set subjective high minimum bar is inevitably also an unconsciously set low maximum bar. You’ll never stall, but you’ll cease to surprise.

I should name this. Yield-rate/next-peak tradeoff under fixed minimum quality. If you try to increase yield rate, next peak will be lower, and vice versa. Or more precisely, the next “all time high” (ATH) will be a smaller improvement over last. Diminishing marginal altitude.

Even money doesn’t break this tradeoff, which is a rare failure of money to solve problems outside of death. Money allows you to add a new dimension (depth/difficulty) but not break basic yield-rate/next-peak tradeoff. The *only* way is to lower quality bar and open up direction.

MCU is a great example in high-money end. MCU lost top property (Spider-Man) to Sony due to bad contracts. So they dropped bar and made things work with second-string properties. When that had stall problems (Hulk 2, Thor 2), they dropped bar again (Guardians of Galaxy)! Gutsy.

By contrast, Sony failed to capitalize on the momentum of the first 2 Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies and had to deal with MCU eventually. They only belatedly figured out the p,ay book sort of, with Venom stand-alone.

DC otoh, had no such corporate conflicts to navigate. The Nolan Batman trilogy was better than the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy. The DCEU should have been *easier* to build. But Superman fumbled etc. They even screwed up a naive copying of the bar-lowering trick (Suicide Squad)

Wonder Woman kinda bailed them out partly, but couldn’t salvage the justice league level of the franchise. I haven’t yet watched Harley Quinn.

Point of this is to underline the lesson that money doesn’t solve a guts problem. You and I don’t have billions to throw at our crappy little blog-scale extended universes, or the talent of a Kevin Feige, or the blessing-in-disguise of being barred from using our top IP. But...

We still face the exact same yield-rate/next-peak challenge, stall problems, and the courage challenge of counter-intuitively lowering bar and diving to get out of a stall.

There’s also a “beginner mind” and sunk-cost-fallacy side to this analysis that I’ll let you work out for yourself.

There’s also something to be said for occassionaly cashing out earned skill by doing a quality-controlled, focused, somewhat formulaic things. That’s what Nolan Batman trilogy was. Came 7 years after he “arrived”. But then he did take risks again with Inception, Interstellar, etc

The trick is to treat the quality-controlled stuff as finite game periods that are breaks from the quality-selected infinite game backdrops. Formulas as good servants but bad masters. Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood are examples of not going back after going formula.

As you might guess, I’m trying to talk myself into a dive out of a stall. 🤣

hard part is becoming aware of subconsciously internalized quality bar so I can violate it.

I’m also overdue for a spot of quality-controlled cash-out action. Last one was breaking smart S1.

Both diving to get out of a stall and going on rock-steady cruise control at an efficient altitude to “cash out” usually require cash reserves or steady funding. Need money to reorient vs need money to go deep. Two ways to use $. Kinda like seed funding vs growth/scaling funding.

$ and creation interact differently in quality control (QC) vs quality selection (QS) modes.

In QC mode, you need $ during tooling period. Building infrastructure needed for low-variance steady output.

In QS mode, you need $ while retraining quality filter after a dive+reorient

In QC mode, you have a long period of no output to patch over because you’re building tooling. Capex. In writing, that’s reading, building and testing frameworks (=scaffolding/rigging) to hold production flows later, instrumentation (=edit pass filters) to check quality etc.

In QS mode, you have a long period with no “hits” as your quality filter is getting retrained for a new direction. The sign is a hit drought: ATHs languish in the “crap” band because you can’t recognize and double down on the good bits (which are there).

Sometimes you have to do both QS and QC at the same time, like when learning a new medium and achieving the “cost of doing business” minimum level of QC.

Or when you’re genuinely pushing hard limits. Apollo required BOTH insane levels of QC and the QS iteration. Takes lots of $$

Hmm, 2x2. Low to high QC, low to high QS.

Low QC/low QS: failing at play
Low QC/high QS: playing well
High QC/low QS: skilled craft work
High QC/High QS: pioneering

Semiconductors are a good example of top-right. Moore’s law = always trying to ride the edge of both high-QC design process and high-yield fab process. You want bug-free chips at high fab yield rates.

## 43. The Financial Lensing Effect

*May 3, 2020*

Very large quantities of concentrated capital can bend truth rays and warp epistimology and ontology. There is a financial lending effect by which you can detect the presence of large cold masses of money that otherwise can’t be seen

Very tired of how financial lensing effects muck up everything I find interesting and worthwhile about life, the universe, and everything. Brings out worst in people. If I were religious I’d call money the embodiment of the devil.  The effect is very nonlinear in amount of money

Lensing not lending

I’m not particularly bothered by high inequality per se. But the warping it causes in the top levels of society is really unpleasant to see close up. This last year or so has been particularly rich in such odious spectacles, and it has sharply accelerated with the pandemic.

It’s hilarious how people worry about cute little cognitive biases at the individual level when the entire human condition is in orbit around a money black hole, with the wealthiest orbiting closest, with most warping.

To a first approximation, “less wrong” is just “not too closely in orbit around large piles of money” (but not too far either... but the consequences of cognitive distortions of extreme poverty are mostly limited to you, you can’t screw up the world at large beyond a point)

Looking back, I’ve expended huge efforts in my life trying to keep my thinking clear of the distortionary effects of money — having it, not having it, being near piles of it, being far from piles of it. Trying to be something of a money neutrino. Pass right through unaffected.

In my idea of a better world, money would simply be yet another global coordination/communication/computation tool, like traffic signs or air traffic control radar systems. A few would nerd out over it, most would be slightly bored by it but have enough and deal with it.

You wouldn’t have the entire human condition enslaved by obsession with it, with the top leaders of any consequential hierarchy being absolutely obsessed with maximal accumulation of it. Money is simply not that interesting.

To make a comparison, language is like money in many ways, a global tool of coordination, computation, and communication. But we’re kinda sane about it. We don’t revere large piles of words. Librarians of the largest libraries aren’t treated like Bill Gates is with money.

Here’s a small glimpse of why I dislike what large concentrations of money does to humanity. Say you gave a 3rd gen failson sitting on 100 million with no ideas. So, he sounds on yachts, booze, prostitutes, whatever. You could argue that the “dumb money” gets smart 1 degree out

1 degree out, the $ goes to yacht designers, bartenders, etc. So damage seems low. One person living a life I would not want for myself. But who am I to judge. Except it’s not just one person. Hundreds of people are living lives shaped by the logic of 1st order failson spending.

Would they do something else more fulfilling with their lives if their best option hadn’t been pandering to unimaginative failson’s miserable idea of a good life?

The economy is often compared to a large distributed computer (correct). It is often assumed to be an efficient computer under some narrow conditions (also kinda correct). What is not often talked about is — who programs it and for what. And the answer to that is not pretty.

It is programmed by the stewards of the largest, slowest piles of money. Each dollar you hold is like a right to one cpu cycle. Even governments can’t alter this landscape wholesale. Only reshape it in certain known ways.

It’s like if your family had one tv and the tantrummy 5 year old insists on controlling the remote and will only allow the tv to play his favorite kid cartoons on endless repeat. It’s a powerful device but can do only a fraction of what it is capable of.

That’s what even an ideal efficient market controlled by large capital piles is like.

I don’t mind spending a reasonable fraction of my time thinking about my personal finances. Cost of doing the business of living life. But i grudge every minute I have to devote to modeling and predicting consequence of existence of large piles of tens/hundreds of billions.

If I’m consulting for a company that makes widgets its because I am interested in widgets. Not in the psychology of a dozen bores who own the PE company that bought the widget company and don’t give a shit about widgets.

I hate that any sufficiently important and interesting project turns into a “money psychology of boring people” project if you give it long enough. Kinda like how any social media product turns into a messaging app if you give it enough time. So everybody has to think about that.

One of my weird influences is Alberto Moravia’s Time of Desecration, which I randomly read as a teenager because it happened to be around. Not the sort of book I’d pick myself. But the theme of desecrating money stayed with me. https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1980/08/14/moravias-victims/

## 44. Learning as Rental over Ownership

*June 14, 2020*

Stuff you learned and forgot feels like rent paid. You lived in it for a while but are now left with no equity in it. Most schooling only rents you some knowledge for a while.

You’re left with only enough knowledge capital to find and rent it again. Like knowing the address of apartments you’ve rented before. I don’t know much but I’ve rented a lot of stuff over the years. My address book is nearly full.

Well, it’s more than an address book. It’s a map. So there’s that.

Maybe this is why I’m meh on lifelong learning. A holistic philosophy of learning requires an attitude towards loss and degradation of knowledge too. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1227401269498671104?s=21 https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1227401269498671104

I admire people who get into stuff like spaced repetition to strive mightily against such effects, but I have a more wabi-sabi attitude towards it. Kintsugi knowledge over valiantly maintained mastery. https://twitter.com/andrewm_webb/status/1272187530532839425?s=21 https://twitter.com/AndrewM_Webb/status/1272187530532839425

Almost everything is worth knowing for a while or in specific situations. Almost nothing is worth knowing forever or in all situations. Most knowledge is only rent-worthy. When it degrades (a deeper, more irreversible kind of loss than mere forgetting) you should generally let it

We often fetishize ignorance (stuff we’ve never yet known) by performing some sort of pious humility to exhibit our consciousness of it. But curiously, we have no cultural attitude towards stuff once known but now lost. Or at least stored in ways requiring restorative work.

Temporal partitition of known-unknown:

Once-known unknown: Stuff you used to know that’s now degraded

Could-be-known unknown: Stuff you know is out there that you could know, like apartments you could rent

Never-knowable unknowns: Stuff you know is beyond your learning reach

Thing about knowledge degradation is that it is arbitrary and has only a weak relationship to retention desires.

“It’s like riding a bike” effect. Ancient environment of evolutionary adaptation dictates that my somatic hardware retains bike-riding knowledge weirdly well. Shrug.

2x2: Knowledge you’d like to retain/lose vs knowledge that actual sticks vs degrades. Aptitude = Stuff you’d like like to retain and naturally does get retained, making maintenance cheap (it sticks with little/no reinforcement like bike-riding, which I actually do want to retain)

Curious that people find this to be a tragic line of thought. I find it liberating and am not really upset by it. In fact I kinda appreciate knowledge being naturally lossy.  https://twitter.com/tahsin_mayeesha/status/1272191000803336193?s=21 https://twitter.com/tahsin_mayeesha/status/1272191000803336193

“Use it or lose it” has a hugely important corollary: how much you have to use something to retain it varies enormously from “riding a bike” (afaict that’s once every decade after acquisition) to “must use every week and will be lost in months/years if not” like advanced math.

Your knowledge degradations form a unique fingerprint that create a signature style of how how you do new things. Like the gold seams on a kintsugi bowl uniquely identify its past of cracks and breaks. It still holds stuff, but in a unique way. Your brain is a kintsugi bowl.

Writing is a good example. Everybody retains/loses particular preferred/not-preferred words/idioms/usages that form a particular unique “voice” ... one that could be identified by an AI classifier and reproduced by gpt-2 type algorithms.

Feels like Homo sapiens is ready to evolve past uncritical fetishization of knowing for the sake of knowing (Homo... studentus?) to actual “sapiens” ("discerning, wise, sensible") by treating knowing as a commodity rent/buy decision for the most part.

There is certainly a kind of pleasure to learning and acquiring knowledge, whether to rent or own. But uncritically maximizing that pleasure is a kind of hedonism. We just don’t notice because society approves of it morally, and rewards it economically.

Erudition: What you know
Wisdom: What you know about what you know
Humbletalebry: What you don’t know
Prowess: What you can do
Nihilism: What you must do
Scholarship: What you know about who knows what
Craft: What you’ve forgotten
Artistry: What has irreversibly degraded

Religion: What you refuse to know
Tribalism: What you refuse to do
Bureaucratism: What others must know
Imperialism: What others must be able to do

## 45. Two Kinds of Investing

*June 28, 2020*

The word “invest” has 2 distinct meanings in relation to capital:

Invest (1): Spend money to build a capability. Example: a bridge, a factory, a mansion.

Invest (2): Spend money to acquire a formal stake in an existing capability. Example: stock, bond, lien.

2 now dominates 1

The two are coupled. For example, you invest (2) in my company so I can invest (1) in a new factory. Instead of shareholder value or a dividend, you might claim a share of the output at a good price for example (offtakes, kinda like futures) https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offtake-agreement.asp

To me it seems like the natural arrangement. The recent thing with negative oil prices should not seem weird at all. When you buy oil futures, the natural assumption should be that you’ll actually take delivery. Invest (2) should imply a direct stake in invest (1).

It’s a moral hazard to purely invest (2) in money-in-money-out (MIMO) ways. You have no interest in how black box works. All knowledge risk lies with investee. If your MIMO deal is not honored you can’t tell fraud apart from real problems. You can’t judge whether to grant relief.

This is the definition o dumb money. Of course most real investment (2) does informally include some appreciation of the underlying investment (1), but not in any way that is operationally specific. Few investors who play for even controlling stakes actually desire control.

Control in finance has come to mean “control of the board and ability to hire/fire top executives” which is increasingly just too shallow to address the complexity of modern principal-agent relations. Money *wants* to be stupid because the wealthy don’t want to do invest (2) work

Financialization, “shareholder value” as a disease etc all have their roots in a single psychological problem: the rich are really lazy. They don’t want to put in the work to make their money smart. They want to either swarm opportunities via imitation, or rely on “analysts”

Sorry, typo... 2 tweets up should be “don’t want to do invest (1) work” https://twitter.com/maxwells_d3mon/status/1277268243405815809?s=21 https://t.co/SWm2n4VBqS

There is a lot of bullshit conservative sermonizing about how the poor deserve their fates because they don’t work hard and that’s why the economy suffers etc. This is not only not the problem, it is not even true. Most economic problems arise from the rich not work hard enough.

If you have 10s of millions of dollars, it *matters* how hard you, PERSONALLY think about where to put it. Even a single degree of delegation creates huge principal-agent distortions. To the extent some wealth creation opportunities need concentrated capital, the rich must think.

Some rich do think and work hard but they think wide and shallow for the “highest ROIC” (where the I is investment (2), not (1)) opportunities. They rarely think deep about how a particular invest (2) will drive the invest (1). They don’t care about the meaning of the money.

There is something deeply nihilistic, stupid, fearful, and acting-dead about this. If the only difference between 2 investments for you is return rates, and you are not curious about the futures implied by investing in either, you’re kinda dumb and boring.

“Capital seeking returns” is a stupid 1-quarter-out mindset. It aspires to be as smart as evolution, which is also “blind”, but doesn’t have a similar (2) —> (1) indirection injecting stupidity. Genes don’t magically jump to the most fecund species driving booms/busts.

If biological evolution, to which market is often compared, were as stupid as market, entire gene pool would have jumped into the horniest pair of rabbits a million years ago and life would have vanished in one giant subprime rabbit boom and bust. Evolution invests (1), not (2).

Ie capital is too mobile. It has ADHD. It rarely hangs around long enough to learn about survival in a given evolutionary niche and create civilizational wealth there. The exception is when people like Musk force money to pay attention, making invest (1)= invest (2)

Notably capital markets have a notion of seeking alpha (novel information to guide investment) but no notion of how long that information needs to be acted on to realize value. New alpha simply moves the money, regardless of whether or not it actually invalidates previous alpha.

It’s obvious why. Because capital is so imitative, the primary payoff of alpha is convincing others there *is* alpha. Most invest (2) is a bigger-fool scheme that has zero structural interest in the actual meaning of a piece of alpha.

Better mousetrap? Most value lies in convincing others it is better.

Teleportation technology? Most value lies in convincing others it is exciting.

Capital isn’t interested in either unless someone detains it by force for long enough.

There have been ideas like long term stock market etc, but I think they’re too crude and give up too much information sensitivity. 

Kind of thing I have in mind would be stocks that act like bonds. What if stocks were priced based on how long you were willing to hold?

Not RSUs or options per se. The same stock would cost $10 instead of $15 if you committed not to sell until next year etc. Ie invest (2) would effectively rent, not own equity. But not in the sense of options. A hotel room night costs more than a year lease on apartment for eg.

One of the reasons I’m in indie consulting is I only have time to invest, not money. But the other reason is that it allows you to bridge invest (2) (abstract management theories, macro trends) and invest (1) (applying it to a specific company, going as deep as possible)

Not all consultants do this. There are lazy equivalents to investors (2) who you can call consultants (2). Jump from client to client, never bothering to understand any business, shilling the same “process” workshop regardless of context. Lean, “design thinking”, holacracy 🙄

Detest those types. They give the rest of us a bad name. There is no such thing as a context-independent business process or function. If you don’t care to learn about a business and adapt your offering, you’re lazily peddling fads the same way investors (2) lazily pump up stocks

But back to economy after that bit of product placement. This whole point is why I’m not a socialist. I don’t think it matters much who “owns” the capital. Whether it is a workers coop or a fat-cat single rich person, the question is how hard they think.

A single wealthy person might decide where to put a million dollars by spending 10 hours thinking about it.

A collective of 100 people each with a 10k stake in a million might spend an hour each thinking about it, so 100 hours. 

100 diverse hours or 10 single-mind hours?

On paper that’s 10x the hours but most of it will go to solving the coordination problem. The collective will be smarter in some cases, he single mind will be smarter in others.

The solution is a mix of concentrated and distributed capital pools driven by both kinds of smarts.

I’m learning this the hard way with the @yak_collective

Some projects I’d take to that consulting collective hive-mind, others I’d do by myself. Very different challenges.

Same with money. Distributed investing is very hard. This is why passive investment in everything works.

This tldrs the whole thread so far 😂 https://twitter.com/jimyoull/status/1277286206997327872?s=21 https://twitter.com/JimYoull/status/1277286206997327872

You can’t fix the problems of markets and capitalism by changing who gets to be stupid and uninterested in the details of where it goes. Smart money is simply money that is paying attention to what it is doing.

No matter what the mechanism and who is investing, attention is key.

Radical thought: centrally planned Soviet communism and Chinese capitalism aren’t actually that different from Western markets. All suffer from the exact same divorce between invest (1) and invest (2) leading to dumb ADD money.

They all just have different externalities.

You could actually construct a Dictator’s Handbook style grand unified model comparing all three consistently. Selectorate theory can compare the substance of governance systems while ignoring their formal doctrinal differences. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory

In that theory you compare democracies and dictatorships in terms of 3 groups: nominal selectorate, real selectorate, winning coalition. Aka interchangeables, influentials, essentials.

In my economic theory: passive investors, investor-2s, investor-1s.

USSR, modern China, and modern West represent differences in degree, not kind. All 3 are just different points in the 3D vector space of investor-selectorate theory.

For USSR, Spufford’s Red Plenty comes highly recommended. I’ve read summaries. https://www.amazon.com/Red-Plenty-Francis-Spufford/dp/1555976042

Okay, after a run and a shower, I have more to say. 

I probably have among the biggest income source spans on the planet. I’ve been paid directly by billionaires and centimillionaires for consulting, and by starving artists who can barely make rent via newsletter subs/ebook buys

This makes me part of the direct service class, not that different from butlers or restaurant waiters. Bridging two very different worlds. Each side unconsciously tries really hard to avoid direct, humanizing contact with the other.

There is a motivated interest in doing this. Humanizing contact falsifies glib generalizations like “the poor are just lazy” or “the rich are just venal” and class-based theories of how things fail. This allows them to blame absolutely everything systemically wrong on other side.

On both sides I listen more than I talk (which may seem impossible to some who complain that I talk too much), while making it clear that the counterparty should not assume my sympathies. One way or another I’m being paid to think on their behalf, not commiserate. Like a lawyer.

To both sides I’m slightly suspect. The poor are suspicious of my work with the rich, and I’m often accused outright of being a petit bourgeoisie capitalist shill. Which is 100% true.

Equally the rich often suggest I’m a commie in bourgeois disguise. Also 100% true.

The opposite of every great truth is also a great truth.

The poor are exploited. True.

The poor are ressentiment driven identitarians who may or may not work hard. Also true.

The rich are lazy venal rentiers. True.

The rich are burdened with large responsibilities. Also true.

This is class-based bothsidesism of course, which is why the worst of both sides are the ones who hate people like me the most (“vertical centrists” perhaps?). 

But for every systemic failure theres plenty of blame to distribute from top to bottom of pyramid.

Every class is complicit in how the world works. Every class has its full complement of sociopaths, clueless and losers. Every class has lazy and hard working types. Every class has people with fixed and fluid class identities. It’s a fractal thing.

Despite the fact that rewards of the system working are very unevenly distributed, ironically, every class winning or losing in terms of rewards seems super attached to the identities that keep the system the same. They want more rewards, but don’t want to change their identities

To bring it back around to investing, there is investing in *yourself* to consider.

Self-Investors (1) invest in their own growth, destroying last identities to forge new ones.

Self-Investors (2) double down harder and harder on who they think they are.

There’s also Self-Investors 1.5. People who “grow” in a limited way reducible to class mobility.

Start rich, fall into poverty and go commie. Start poor, get rich, and go capitalist.

They say you’re the mean of your 5 best friends. These class-movers just change their 5. 🙄

In Great Tuth terms, these 1.5ers never achieve any sort of integration between opposed great truths. They just go from one great truth to its negation, by cherrypicking a different subset of confirmatory evidence from their experiences.

There’s a behavior I call default-stereotype switching.

Going socialist to capitalist? Switch poor-default from the suffering, exploited people you know to the resentful lazy ones. Going the other way? Switch rich-default from generous entrepreneur to Wall Street scammer.

So long as you don’t pop out of the class-mobility identity ladder entirely, and drop class-based defaults of admiration and contempt for individuals, you’re part of the problem. Which is fine. It’s not a shaming. It means you’ll be manipulated as interchangeable passives.

Not a coincidence: every single time anyone has strongly criticized me for my values, politics, or aesthetics (usually lack thereof), when I look, there’s a strong, hardened class identity behind it (this is not true of competence/skill/ignorance criticisms, which I appreciate)

I’m pretty bourgeois. Petit, not haute. It’s traditionallly been the least admired class, inviting the most contempt. The identitarian poor see it as a snobbish climber class. The identitarian rich see it as a gauche not-even-new-money class.

It is the most fluid-identity class.

The upside of being in maximal contempt zone is that it is the zone where it is most difficult to harden an identity. There are no bourgeois manifestos or middle-class ideological tracts *for the bourgeois*, despite this being the class that writes these things for other classes

Writing *about* the petit bourgeois is almost universally unsympathetic. Much of it by members of the class themselves, via ritual self-flagellation. This is the world of Babbitts and Karens. They are portrayed as standing for nothing except their own comfort and convenience.

But middle-class societies tend also to be the ones in which human nature evolves fastest, through identity creative-destruction, as tidal forces of contempt from above and below tear apart and reconstitute the class, every generation. They also staff the investor (1) world.

Rich and poor usually don’t change and don’t want to change. They have stable identities they aspire to, conform to, and then cling to with hardened determination. The petit bourgeois middle class doesn’t have this psychological luxury. It evolves as a series of tropes and memes.

I don’t mind this. I’m fine with my life story being a series of bad memes that don’t cohere. Wojack today, Karen tomorrow. Neither world-denting Straussian-Girardian hero n or working class hero. Maybe I’ll title my autobiography “Glub and brrr: the story of a series of memes”

Positive archetypes are for people who live on maps. Investor (2) types, whether they invest with money or hardened self-congratulatory class identities that make growth an imperative for everybody but themselves. The price of living on the territory is being reduced to a meme.

## 46. Bullshit Jobs and Culture Wars

*June 30, 2020*

Culture war wrangling has unfortunately become a key element in my consulting. It is now the 4th, and youngest manifestation of bullshit jobs.

Bullshit jobs evolve in one of 4 ways: automation, outsourcing, trumpification, and now: wokification. Only the first 2 are survivable

Automation: job becomes automatable, human incumbents desperately add “ineffable human” bullshit, get laid off anyway.

Trust me: this is the best outcome. If you’re an executive, try your best to solve management problems this way. Especially with middle managers.

Outsourcing: the main benefit of a cheaper location may not be obvious to you. It’s the ability to strip away bullshit added to justify high first-world salaries. Hungrier people willing to work for less tend to cut away performative bullshit. Low cost is justification enough.

Trumpification: When an ethnic group consolidates labor power and “captures” a labor market so strongly it can induce protectionism. Bullshit signifiers get added as “essential” to the bullshit job. Example: people around the world deal with cattle. Cowboy hats are not essential.

Wokification: the newest kid on the block. Arcane academic theories get operationalized as inscrutable HR it us impossible to not be in violation of, and nobody can dislodge it because the jobs in question are bullshit and lack grounded ways of measuring performance.

Managerial literacy now includes skill at preventing the last two cancers from taking root, and being a humane but firm proponent of the first two. Yes I’m an unrepentant neoliberal shill. I believe bullshit jobs should be automated immediately if possible, and outsourced if not.

Leadership now means being an oncologist. If your middle managers have failed to prevent cancerous trumpification or wokification, your job as an executive is to point to the writing on the wall: companies that outsource or automate will beat yours, *despite* trade barriers.

In general humans should be employees of last resort for any job. The less a job actually needs high-end human abilities computers can’t provide, the more humans will fill the gap between “essential” and “fulfilling” with identitarian bullshit to make it fulfilling.

You think that’s the hard part? Dream on. Preventing and/or curing cancer is just the opening act. The problem is, the more you automate or outsource (which is automation-lite or pre-automation for a variety of reasons) the more the remaining humans matter.

Divide your company market cap or gross revenue by number of employees. The higher that number the more each one matters. Now take the reciprocal of number of employees and multiply by 100. That’s percent HR weight of an individual. If both are high each employee is a huge risk.

Why? Because each employee has HUGE leveraged influence on the product or service. You’ve heard of opinionated design perhaps. The fewer and higher value each employee the more their opinions are a *product feature*. And the more you need each to be exceptionally wise.

Not just smart or skilled or talented. 

*wise*

Like sage-wise. Philosopher-wise.

As in not a sophomoric weed-session way. Or reddit nerd-groupie way. Or insecure cult-leader-seeking child way. This isn’t about brain power. It’s about genuine curiosity about hard questions.

Trumpification and wokification are the exact opposite of sagification.

Trust me: if you can’t stop these processes from metastasizing your company will die. If they take over a sector, the sector will die.

Neither trade wars, nor fine-grained regulation can stop it.

You can’t fight economic gravity with human identity.

What’s more, you *shouldnt*. 

It’s unethical for a manager or leader to “pad” a job with performative identity elements to make it faux-fulfilling. Humans do not flourish as 20% genuine challenge, 8p% pieces of flair.

As an employee (or hell, a free-agent self-employee) you should be ahead of your bosses/clients on this. If you aren’t continuously looking for ways to automate or outsource yourself you’re hiding from your own maximally expressed humanness.

Thus has been creeping up me. 9 years ago when I went free-agent it was not even a thing. For managers/leaders everywhere, automation and outsourcing were real hard competencies to develop. Dealing with trumpification and wokification was just an easy compliance chore.

Now this stuff is everywhere. And we all have to learn to manage and lead (and consult) in live minefield conditions. Perhaps we deserve it for sweeping these problems under the rug for so long. But well, they’re here now. And the incentives to solve them wrong are strong.

The wrong way is to avoid these problems by gratefully delegating them to the first people who seem to want to deal with them. *These are exactly the wrong people*.  Anyone volunteering to work on this thankless shit is 90% likely to be a grifter, 10% likely to be a saint.

The right person to deal with this stuff is not a special interest group grifter or HR careerist but CEOs and senior execs with P/L or product responsibility. People who will be hurt on comp and reputation by the wrong solutions. Culture war navigation is now job #1 for you.

Cultural safety is to 2020 what workplace physical safety was in the 1800s, when industrial accidents from boiler explosions, falling objects and crap was threatening to derail industrial growth.

If you can’t ensure baseline cultural safety for *all* (plural) in the workplace, your business strategic acumen, product genius, marketing mono, and customer obsession *don’t matter*

Your company won’t last long enough to realize the value of those higher order competencies.

Oddly enough falling physical safety is a deep symptom of bullshit-jobification. If you need workers to be in physical danger to do their work, one of 3 things is true:

a) You live in 1890
b) You fun a military or police org
c) You’re failing to automate/outsource well in 2020

Why do Tyson meats factory workers have to risk Covid on insane 130-birds-per-minute slaughter lines working 2 feet from each other? It’s not 1890, it’s not a military job.

Same: healthcare workers, many service workers. Painful to admit but right answer is: automate/outsource

Note: despite perceptions of sweathshops and Foxconn, outsourcing done well *increases* worker safety relative to jobs lost in high-cost geographies.

Low cost basis means you can achieve same output with better treated employees. Precarious wages here are princely elsewhere.

Same with white collar workers. 

You don’t have to be a woke ideologue to accept that workplace minorities shouldn’t have to be 2x as good for 0.5x reward relative to majority mediocrity

You don’t have to be alt-right to accept that extreme speech policing kills a workplace

These problems have good managerial/leadership solutions *so long as the jobs are not bullshit jobs* 

If they are bullshit jobs. There’s no solution.

If they aren’t both are easy. Real recognize real. Output quality shows. Trusted bonds form that accommodate unpoliced speech.

So seriously, to get ahead of culture war cancers before they arrive at your org, automate, outsource the bullshit out of the jobs ggressively, create physical and cultural safety by grounding everything in quality shipped output and the high-trust bonds they catalyze.

Like I said, this stuff has crept up on me as well. It’s not stuff I enjoy consulting on, but over the years it has migrated from minor annoyance in peripheral vision to footnote to other items, to “oh, one more thing” agenda item in sparring sessions with clients to item #1

I’d *much* rather work with clients on tech roadmaps, org structure, product vision, innovation management, market modeling, branding/positioning, OODA loops... all the fun stuff. The growth of this other stuff almost makes me want to quit consulting and bet on writing full-time.

I still might. If I find myself spending more than 30% of my time helping clients navigate this stuff, it’ll be time to quit. And possibly invest in a bunker or sailboat.

The enterprise today is where internet culture was in 2013: on the cusp of descent into internet of beefs madness. If you thought that shit has been toxic in the 7 years since, wait till we get to the intranet of beefs. It will be utterly awful. I’m seeing 2013-level signs now.

In 2013 I underestimated both speed and magnitude of the internet of beefs exploding and shaping mainstream public life. I don’t want to make a similar mistake with the enterprise edition. We haven’t yet had the enterprise edition of something like gamer gate. Let’s try not to.

Covid is a HUGE shock to the business world and has accelerated the reckoning with this stuff. Soon, like in 1-2 years, the window of opportunity to do the right things (cut bullshit out of jobs) will close. Not only will only wrong solutions be available, they will be mandatory.

Covid is to the private/business world what Trump was to the public culture war: a virus that precipitates cascading rapid change in the environment as pent-up dams burst. If you’re a BTFSTTG happy at the prospect you’re either rich or an idiot. Possibly both.

To survive Trump we went cozyweb. 

The corporate intranet is the OG cozyweb. 

What are you going to do when it goes up in flames?

If your title is VP or higher it’s your job to answer that question. 

If the answer saves bullshit jobs it’s the wrong answer.

I’m going to refer back to this thread in 2024. If I’m right — and I hope I’m not — the business world will be in as much of a meltdown by then as the public world was in 2017. Those who saw it coming and acted in time will see their businesses/orgs survive. The rest will die.

Coda: I’ll turn 46 this year. I finally have enough experience across enough gigs that I’m fairly confident about my instincts on this stuff. Unfortunately I also have enough experience to not want to touch this stuff with a 10-foot pole.

This is not what I was hoping my midlife career would be about. In 2011 the plan was to gradually do less consulting and more fun writing and making more money with less work based on a couple of decades of experience with “normal and fun” business problems.

I now charge about 3x per hour as I did when I first started out. And I think I add more than 3x as much value per hour — if I’m having fun. 

Big if. 

That if is increasingly not true in culture-war consulting. The years of experience don’t matter if you dislike the work.

Fingers crossed that the business world sees this looming and acts to steer it down a better path. Otherwise my next 4 years will be increasingly miserable, and my 50s, which I’d hoped would be 3-4 hours lucrative consulting and 30-40 hours fun writing, will be very different.

## 47. On Grifts

*June 30, 2020*

Grifts are undertheorized, and too often conflated with long cons, scams, frauds and other more blatant soft crimes. Lemme offer a definition.

A grift is a scheme that profits from the existence of a real problem without actually addressing it.

Small grifts merely exploit the problem. Big grifts perpetuate it.

A grift is particularly stable because unlike a true scam it doesn’t offer decisive solutions that claim to fully solve it and can therefore proved to not work. Theranos was a scam, not a grift.

Grifts are not long cons either. Cons exploit timeless human fallibility (see for example Erving Goffman classic “on cooling the mark out”). Grifts otoh exploit potentially solvable problems.

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00332747.1952.11022896

Grifts are not frauds either. Occassionaly they may rely on misinformation, bad science or philosophy but rarely on intentionally falsified information or scholarship.

Frauds involve deliberate lying that could be exposed. Grifts are built on shaky but not false ground.

Grifts feed the urge to “do something” to stop feeling helpless in the face of hard problems.

If it looks like a theater about a hard problem, and fits the “-washing” suffix, it’s a grift.

Greenwashing
Covidwashing 
Wokewashing
Magawashing
Security theater

All grifts.

Grifts feed what was called the politicians syllogism is Yes, Prime Minister:

We must do something
This is something
We must do this

Usually the utter mismatch between problem and supposed solution is obvious to experienced people. It is obvious how it will fail on day 1.

But it is really hard to explain because the weakness is at the level of systems impedance mismatch. You can’t prove it can’t work. And sometimes a grift is timed right so it is active when broader forces actually cause movement on the problem, and the grifters can claim credit.

Grifts often rely on narrative vacuums. When the real story is too complicated or boring or requires numbers and graphs to understand, people reach for the simpler story. Grifters supply it.

Plastic straw ban bullshit narrative? Pure 100% sustainability grifter theater.

You don’t even have to be a sustainability expert. Five minutes googling reveals that plastic straws are not a real problem, that the whole campaign was based on some kid’s estimate, that fishing nets are the actually biggest source of plastic waste etc etc.

Anybody who knowingly pushed and hyped that thing literally does not care about the environment, climate action or sustainability. They merely want to profit from the existence of climate action as a hard problem,em people are motivated to do something about. Grifters.

The world is currently overflowing with hard problems, so it is overflowing with grift as well. 

To be continued. Gotta shower, eat, and do a meeting.

A good way to tell a grift apart from other similar things is to ask: if it is exposed as such, does it get undermined completely or can it still survive. Grifts can survive exposure by claiming to be about instilling values. Which is almost a good argument.

For eg. consider this hypothetical exchange:

"The plastic straws thing is bullshit"

"I know, but still, it raises awareness of plastic waste as an issue"

"But the real problem of fishnet waste and microparticulates aren't addressed!"

"Straw campaign is still worth something."

There are grey area grifts. For example, is recycling a grift?

Most stuff can't actually be "recycled" with net reduction in environmental impact (besides clean PET, aluminum).

Recycling is in crisis (China National Sword, plus Covid)

Still: maybe instilling behaviors is good?

I'm on the fence on this one. Recycling doesn't work now, but *could* be made to work, and it's good to have those behaviors installed -- so long as people are actively working on the problem. If they're not (currently they're not), why bother with "aspirational recycling"?

But overall, I don't think recycling is a grift. At best it is collective wishful thinking. And it could still kinda work out.

But the important point is that when you switch the justification from "it works" to "it installs values/creates awareness" you're suddenly changing the economic and effort logic. Actual solutions are worth much more than "creating awareness" about a problem.

If you've installed a lucrative and profitable habit that an org is used to doing, stopping it is both hard and counterproductive to the grifting motive. Why not charge "solution" rates for "awareness" palliatives if the suckers will continue to pay?

By contrast, scams, frauds, long cons... when they are exposed, they become untenable. Buying back into the narrative on alternative premises is impossible. The lie is just too big and blatant.

Almost all business consulting offerings structured as domain-independent process training and workshops are almost-grifts. Almost because they cut to the chase and pitch "awareness" and "values" level value propositions from the start, never even pretending to solve the problem.

Another clear "tell" of a grift: there are no learnable skills that are unique to the grift itself. For example: lean six sigma is a grift because the skilled content is just standard textbook statistics, industrial engineering etc. The meta-stuff is all theatrical bullshit.

Another clear tell: the grift feeds on what I call "learning curve arbitrage" -- it relies on a steady supply of n00bs who don't yet know enough to know what doesn't work, and can be conned into idealistic and energetic belief and performance of theater.

If you as grifter, can find a particularly idealistic, sincere, energetic, and charismatic young ingenue (not necessarily female) to use as figurehead (*cough* Greta *cough* Joan of Arc *cough*) a LOT of grifter reputations can be laundered by BIRGing a genuine idealist.

The presence of such ingenues within a movement is a very clear tell. Snowden, Damore, Greta, etc. etc. It's almost a sign of arrival for a larger grift, at cottage-industry scale (the unicorn scale for grift startups) when they find themselves a charismatic innocent to work with

Btw, this thread on grifting is complementary to my thread on bullshit jobs and where they come from. Grifting creates bullshit jobs if they succeed in installing themselves. Eliminating bullshit jobs is the defense against grifting attacks. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1277760202951897089

I will admit I have a soft spot for grifters who aren't too damaging. The optimal amount of grift in a system is not zero. Grifters do serve one valuable function: draining away clueless idealist energy down distraction bunny trails.

Damnit, I had a couple of great turns of phrase I was thinking of for additional points, but then got distracted by something and forgot them. Now unless I remember them, you'll all have to do without them.

AH YES I recall one of the phrases.

Problem aestheticization. 

Instead of solving a problem, you make it look prettier. Many grifts are based on problem aestheticization. It's literally palliative to sensory trauma. It's like painting a house but billing the cost of the house.

Problem aestheticization is a great way to construct a grift because it at once presents a cheap thing to sell, and a clear audience that will buy. There are 2 kinds of people concerned by a problem.

People concerned about consequences.

People concerned about ugliness.

The thing is, people concerned about the consequences of a problem going unsolved tend to investigate and think through boring, wonky, solution options. You do NOT want these people if you're a grifter.

You want those emotionally traumatized by the *symptoms* of the problem.

If you're a woke grifter working in the racism market, you do NOT want to focus on say incarceration rates because that problem is literally locked away out of sight. There is no opportunity to aestheticize the problem.

You want to focus on say casting decisions in hollywood.

Aestheticization of a problem immediately soothes the emotional trauma of those who can't deal with ugliness. But will they buy the bullshit non-solution? 

Yep. They are also the most likely to be values-based idealists who will stan causes with beautiful performative actions.

Aestheticization, performance, theater, emotional trauma, values, signaling. These are all aspects of the UX design of life. The producers of grift are ideological UX designers. The consumers of grift are people acutely sensitive to the sensory presentation of problems.

Ultimately what you're selling as a grifter is a self-image as an integrated, good person who has agency and exercises it wisely and morally. 

The buyers are precisely people who both lack that self-image and not inclined to poke beneath surface appearances.

Note: this is not exclusively restricted to sensory beauty. Certain kinds of abstract beauty work too. You can aestheticize a problem with beautiful spherical cow economics, and paper over the problem with lovely infographics and chartporn. That's aestheticizing a problem too.

Wonky investigation of the good sort is invariably very, very ugly. The data is a mess. The graphs are underwhelming, there is a messy mix of anecdote and tenuous trends. There is need for a good deal of repeated digging and refinement and ugly data dumpster diving.

Covid is a GREAT example of problem that presents opportunities for both kinds of grifting.

Sensory-aesthetic grifting: dumb-ass designs restaurants with beautiful perspex partitions, mask chic.

Abstract grifting: endless pretty chart porn of case counts.

I'll end with a small mea culpa. Yeah, a lot of what I do is also a bit of a grift. 

I aestheticize problems by finding pretty turns of phrase around which to build satisfying appreciative discourses. But in my defense, I'm  ironic about it, and don't make much money off it.

Bonus: South Park S11E7 Night of the Living Homeless has a great joke about problem aestheticization. Can't find a clip, but here's the script fragment. 

"We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at."

## 48. Taking Things Seriously

*July 4, 2020*

The older I get the more it sinks in that 90% of effectiveness is just taking a thing seriously enough. That translates to just wanting the thing itself rather than adjacent things that may or may not happen as a side effect. Most things sort themselves out if you’re serious. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1279285975860953090

When you’re serious, you are naturally efficient because you don’t get distracted by side goals. You’re naturally as productive as needed because under or overshooting what you seriously want.

Most of the time ambiguity in goal-setting is not about wanting the wrong thing or being confused about means-ends matches. It is about wanting the thing wrong. You want to want the thing-itself. The naked, nominal, stated goal, not psychologically adjacent bullshit.

Half of experience is recognizing when you want the thing versus when you want the thing only because you unconsciously want something else that’s a potential side effect you don’t want to cop to.

The inefficiency of unacknowledged goals cannot be six-sigmaed away. If you’re working out to look good or for endorphin rush l, but pretending to work out for strength/health (even to yourself) the dissonance will make you ineffective at both. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1164362068205531137?s=21

There’s something like “starter” motivation though. Many entrepreneurs start out with chip-on-shoulder motives, like wanting to prove their worth to some bully who punched them at age 8. But the good ones eventually graduate to wanting the actual thing they’re building.

Motivation is a skill. Wanting things is not something you can just “do” beyond lollipop level at age 3. You have to learn to zoom in on the thing that vaguely attracts you, with enough precision that the motivational feedback loop kicks in. Like a starter motor.

This means iterating through various configurations of means and ends, laying on your couch, until the energy surge kicks in and gets you off the couch knowing precisely what to do. Energy must match precision. Otherwise you’re still confused.

If you feel like you’re going to bust through lack of clarity about what you actually want with raw force, you’re in for disappointment. Motivational ambiguity and uncertainty is not the same as environmental uncertainty and ambiguity. It doesn’t yield to brute force.

The 20s are easy. Almost everything people think they want turns out to be indirectly about wanting sex or a partner (or dealing with inability to get them). Once you sort out your feelings about that, motivation around other things gets much simpler. Things get messy at age 30.

Kids know how to actually want things until they turn into teens. Then it gets so hard, they start failing badly at it, attribute it to “angst” and decide they’ll never be able to want things with the clarity of 8-year-olds again. Not true. Just gotta learn adult version.

A lot of goal-selection precision is just emotional range in disguise. The more feelings you’ve felt, and the wider the range of intensities, the more the right goals will click unmistakably in any situation. Gen Z seems to be rediscovering Gendlin/focusing for training this.

Verbal precision is equally important for complex goals though. Goal-motivation-fit is the right word or phrase locking into the right precise emotion about a thing.

For simpler, more somatic goals, something like the description of archery in Herrigel’s Zen and the art of archery is a good guide. Or the inner game of tennis. But for something like a large corporate team project, words become necessary.

Hollywood has a good model for this, in terms of the high concept of movie pitches.

A bad failure mode is when means are clearer than ends. You half-ass learning to want “get a good job” because the means, “do well in college” doesn’t require that clarity of purpose. Then you get the job and realize you don’t want it because you never interrogated the goal.

Incompletion typo in tweet 2. Should read “because under or overshooting what you seriously want kills motivation”

A big part of locking on to motivationally sustainable goals is learning to quit unsustainable ones. This means taking “not feeling it” feeling seriously. It’s almost always a necessary and sufficient reason to quit. Or phone it in at bare minimum if you can’t quit practically.

Emotional fail fast heuristic. Sometimes this is misleading, but usually there’s something off internally. And often externally as well (missing information, felt but unarticulated risk, etc)

Move fast and break things.

Feel fast and break goals.

Crash early, crash often.

Sometimes you can name the reason for quitting (eg “afraid”) and that itself can supply a new motivation for doing it (“build courage”). But then you’ll do it differently. Like running at the high risk part instead of navigating around it wondering why you’re doing it at all.

## 49. The Perils of Uncalibrated Brains

*August 24, 2020*

The longer I spend online, the more true this feels. A big consequence of social atomization is that increasing numbers of people lack a sense of how their thinking stacks up against others. They are either very impressed with themselves OR ridiculously underestimate themselves. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1266118677537026050

This isn’t good or bad. Viewed as an instrument, the brain requires calibration like any other. It produces “insights” that require calibration re: importance, originality, correctness. This is one of the banal functions academia provides. Not “education” but calibration.

Calibrated people have internalized a sense of when their assessments of their own thoughts are likely to match those of others. The cost is, the calibration makes your thinking more middling and mediocre unless you make an effort to protect it, Uncalibrated people

... are either extraordinarily delightful or extraordinarily tedious. 

The former produce works of out-of-left-field genius that are a sheer delight to discover. Online life is enriched by their existence. 

The latter produce tons of mediocre drivel that they *think* is genius.

I’m all for mediocrity that is self-aware of its own mediocrity. That can make it actually fun, and paradoxically elevate it above mediocrity, both for producer and consumer. Irony is the leveler-upper of well-calibrated average brains.

But mediocrity convinced of its own genius (engineers producing crackpot physics theories and pestering physicists with them is a good genre) is the bane of the Internet. But it wasn’t too bad in first couple of decades when they were mostly isolated. Now they can build tribes.

99/100 of these tribes are the one-eyed leading the blind. Uncalibrated people very impressed with themselves attracting other Uncalibrated people looking for cultural leadership. Result: a Cambrian explosion of local consensus realities, all free from calibration.

But what makes this extra frustrating is that the 1 time in 100 when genuinely intellectually pathbreaking tribes form, they struggle. Struggle for resources, institutional support, big patrons, prominent memetic wins, viral vigor...

The median online tribe is much worse than the median institutional tribe. Less rigorous, more bullshitty, less skeptical of itself, more self-certain, less capable of systematic self-doubt... 

But the 1 in 100 will be far superior to the median institutional tribe.

This mediocristan/extremistan difference means that *every* self-important online tribe thinks it is in the 1% of “special” tribes, and it’s everybody else who comprises the unwashed masses pwned by sloppy conspiracy cults. And all think they’re superior to institutional tribes.

I’ve often argued with @nils_gilman, @Aelkus and @Brett_Fujioka about this, and I’m usually the one defending the wisdom of Internet crowds over the complacency of institutional experts, but the picture is just more complex.

I’m not entirely sure where this will go. Institutional authority is crumbling rapidly. I’m probably from last generation to have benefitted from a lot of time in both worlds, when they were both healthy and in a good yin-yang balance of power.

In the future there may be nowhere to go to get your brain calibrated, as universities get sold for parts and social proof of status in subreddits and Facebook groups substitutes for calibration. 

This is one reason I’m suddenly interested in maker/diy type stuff.

Calibration is *expensive* there’s a reason engineering departments have suffered less than humanities. They all have facilities with millions of dollars worth of equipment that won’t flatter your social-proof conceits, and epistemology and pedagogy are both arranged around them.

Find *any* non-human, non-textual source of calibration for your brain and stay connected to it. People and textual culture can only generate social proof, not reality calibration.

It is of course ironic for me to be tweeting this. Producer of a firehose of mostly mediocre text for a “social media” economy that runs on likes. But in my defense, I’ve resisted tribal dynamics all the way, and have never relied on online world for brain (re)calibration.

A red-flag for me that signals poorly calibrated thinking is over-obsession with credit for ideas in any form. While academia can be extraordinarily petty about this, it’s due to lust for rewards not from lack of calibration. People accuse specific others of stealing credit.

Online, it’s more a diffuse and unironic concern with the provenance of ideas and thoughts as though there’s some absolute, unicausal, determinate history to every idea. Because every Uncalibrated Subcultural Bubble has only One True History and it is Uniquely Ours Alone.

You see this in corporations too btw. People without a broader exposure to the history of an idea will assume that a management idea used in a company was invented there.

“Oh, other companies use matrix management too? I thought Ac,e Corp invented it”

Entire countries do it. The Soviet Union practiced what was called Popovism: (term came from insistence that insisting that Alexander Popov invented radio). Oddly enough there is no Wikipedia page for this term. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanovich_Popov

Some helpful aphoristic wisdom (none of it mine)

“The part that is good is not new, and the part that is new is not good” — Martin Sherlock, 1781 (likely) https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/17/good-original/

“A man may do an immense deal of good, if he does not care who gets the credit for it.” — not original to Harry Truman

Stigler’s Law of Eponymy (attributed by Stigler to Robert K. Merton) “no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler's_law_of_eponymy

Quote Investigator btw is a great site for getting calibrated on just how often a) many people independently come up with a version of an idea b) how little it matters c) why it’s actually fine if Einstein and Gandhi between them get credit for saying basically everything first.

The dynamic that creates uncalibrated realities around self-impressed autodidacts on the wild internet is the same one that creates Straussian subcultures in academia and Big Man cultures in business. The desire for leaders which imprints on nearest simpatico self-certain person.

The difference is that Straussian great men and corporate Big Men have to work to shut down calibration in the naturally calibration-focused institutional environment. Or more frequently, have some first-generation acolyte do it for them. Online there’s no calibration from day 1.

The key sign that you’re being owned by a unfalsifiable, uncalibrated textual tradition  is that you’re encouraged to consider some core texts the truth ground. An “up is down” maneuver. Bible, Constitution, online ur texts, incoherent flows of mother-lode memes, Ancient Forums

The devious aspect of the more sociopathic online cults is how they pretend to encourage you to “do your own research, see for yourself”, but all the while nudge/funnel you towards their ur sources by yes-and-ing you where you happen to lean that way, and ignoring where you don’t

Depressingly exploitative and predatory. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1297767323441348608

This is active vandalism of the fragile calibration instincts of vulnerable people. They don’t know they are onstage in a magic act with a conjurer. At least with cult gurus or faith healers there is a stage and an audience that might tip you off that you’re being played.

It’s like a Vegas magic act, except there’s no tickets and no audience doors. Only way into the audience is via the stage, and you only get a seat if you get fully taken in while on the stage. If not you’re out.

If you could find some way to deliver diy brain calibration at scale online, you’d solve mental health, culture war, and fake news, all in one shot. I don’t think it can be done. Calibration is expensive and painful and people have to be paid or otherwise rewarded to endure it.

Reality has a surprising amount of detail — John Salvatier (increasingly climbing the rankings in my best-things-ever-written-online) 

But... textual ity has a surprising amount of detail too. So it’s easy to get disoriented. http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail

The difference is that the detail in textuality is stretched out very thin over a lot of reality. And almost none of it is capable of providing calibration.

Any random object you pick up around your home likely involves more detail than any Big History stretched over centuries.

It’s like increasing magnification without increasing resolving power. You end up with blurry or pixelated results. How do you complete the magic trick with such poor optics?

The CSI Miami trick: “enhance!” 

This is the function of aesthetics and why I distrust aesthetics.

Through interpolation and smoothing, aestheticization stretches a spoonful of reality detail over vastly more reality. The aesthetic filler creates the appearance of additional detail but it’s dead detail. Not capable of supplying brain calibration.

So maybe textuality has a pseudosurprising amount of detail. Like pseudorandom. Which is perhaps why GPT-3 can fake it so well in textual worlds.

## 50. Beliefverse

*September 5, 2020*

Doubt-impedance matching. To persuade smart people, you have to start from a posture of genuine doubt that matches theirs and work both of you into belief together. Belief is a relationship variable, not an individual one. It is founded on mutual information, not private.

If you don’t level-set on doubt (it looks like “take their temperature and match it”), you’ll either be perceived as delusionally overconfident or even psychotic, or pathologically self-doubting to the point you can’t be trusted in a mutual-belief relationship.

If impedance-mismatched persuasion works, one of you is an idiot. If you’re confident you can tell, it’s you.if you have no idea, it’s still you. Paradoxically the surest sign that you’re probably not the idiot is the sneaking suspicion that you might be.

Individuals can’t really “believe” anything. They can only know, not know, or be in a duckrabbit superposition stare. They may know with uncertainty or ambiguity. They may be wrong. But they can’t “believe”

“Belief” exists between 2+ people. All belief is at least mutual belief.

Here I’m referring to intension (with an s) of the word ‘belief’, as a pointer to a particular mental state with characteristic quality. I’ve only ever experienced it in a relational or group context. I suspect this is true of everybody. It’s different from knowing/not-knowing.

I’d define belief as a mode of I-thou “seeing” or mutuality recognition.

Many people seem to think that their knowledge should induce other-belief if enough words, facts, and arguments flow. See recent @harmonylion1 post for what that basically never works.

No, belief is not an internal state change triggered by sufficiently clever inputs.

You can create certain types of uncontrolled false consciousness state shifts (aka “red pill”) that way in people who are on some sort of cognitive brink, but you can’t create precise beliefs without impedance-matched relational evolution. You have to grow into belief together.

This, but generalized, is the syndrome

A good way to think of it is: every belief is a micro-reality. A little universe or timeline. You live in the intersection of millions of such universes. You might share almost all with me, but if I can’t portal-gun into one, you can’t just go there and yell at me to come over.

One does not yell across universe boundaries. The multiverse doesn’t work that way.

I like multiverse metaphors because it makes it easier to practice systematic doubt. I like a version where there are only possible worlds no actual world. Considering actuality to be an unknowable belief intersection with others means you never quite know where you are.

When you are alone with your thoughts you are maximally doubtful, existing in all possible belief universes consistent with your senses. Like a wave function. Every person you entangle with collapses some shared ones into actual beliefs. The bigger the borg, the more you believe.

Getting to mutual belief states with >1 person gets progressively harder, but if you get there, the states are more powerfully belief-like. This is why cults are like gravity wells. You’re in an entangled deep belief collapse state with a lot of others. Extreme decoherence.

Doubt is the live state, belief is the dead state. The relief of belief is the relief of dying a little, with company. To create belief with another person is to destroy doubt with them, and trap a small part of each of you in the universe of that belief. Multisig horcrux.

Gotta refine this metaphor a bit. A better picture might be: you cannot enter the belief multiverse alone at all. Only in company. Where you exist by yourself is just unfactored phenomenological ground. Any sense of belief you experience alone is either memory or anticipation.

This is why seeing/being seen and “recognition” are such a big deal for humans. It’s shared entry into parts of the extended cinematic beliefverse. You see each other by recognizing that you’re each seeing the same thing. You’re now bound by universes you can only enter together.

Sidebar, this is my elaborate explanation for Trump’s weird inability to “see” martyrs and war veterans. I don’t think it’s a moral failing. It’s a mental disability. You don’t have to be patriotic or altruistic to grok why people might risk their lives in wars for fellow humans.

Whether you’re doing it for your buddy in the foxhole or for a larger egregore of patriotic feeling, you’re risking life for beliefs. Which are things shared with others. Completely not mysterious for a normal human. Trump is like a blind man who can’t parse talk of sight.

This is also why it seems like a Trump has no beliefs. That’s because he doesn’t. He’s never entered the beliefverse. Only pushed buttons without understanding what they mean, because meaning rests on mutuality and belief.

But you can’t say he exists in pure doubt like some idealized spherical philosopher in a vacuum, because to know doubt you have to have experienced, and recovered from, belief.  As best as I can reconstruct what it is like to be in his head, it must be a sensory-aesthetic soup.

Knowledge is far less satisfying than belief. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1302123436798435329?s=21

The mathematician in the joke still isn’t living with knowledge alone. He shares the belief-concepts “sheep” and “field” with the other two. It can unravel way more than that.

## 51. Uncertainty Regulation as a Basic Drive

*September 14, 2020*

I've heard of 3 hypothesized "basic drives" for living things: seek pleasure, avoid pain, minimize energy. I don't know that any of them is based on anything more solid than Freud-level hand-waving, but I think there's a fourth one: regulate uncertainty.

As in, arrange behaviors, intentions, expectations, actions to keep uncertainty in a band around a set-point that's comfortable to you.

I've often thought of myself as being driven primarily by the "minimize energy usage" drive (alternately, "path of least resistance") but I think "regulate uncertainty" is a better description.

There's 3 things you can do to regulate uncertainty: increase risk taking, decrease risk taking, and change your operating beliefs. The last one is the most interesting one since it is the foundation of all subjective construction. We design our delusions to regulate uncertainty.

I tend to shut down at fairly low levels of uncertainty compared to many people, especially in certain areas. Bureaucratic uncertainty is especially toxic for me. If I'm waiting for more than 3-5 things like some government document or a financial or opsec thing, I freeze

I regulate this primarily by simply minimizing my surface area for such things. So for eg. I never got into SBIR/STTR type funding sources for small businesess, and tend to avoid using any service that involves interacting with highly involved UXes.

There's a hierarchy here. Minimize energy use is the foundational drive, but is rarely directly triggered, since we're rarely at the limits there So in practice regulate uncertainty is the dominant one. It modulated by our sense of the maximum energy we *could* put out

So for example, I react to the potential for traffic delays by getting to the airport extra early, but that in turn is driven by my sense that I hate sprinting for the gate, and extra-hate the energy demands of rearranging plans if I miss a flight. I do not like having to spike.

"Minimize energy" is a very illegible optimization problem, since our energy efficiency is a complex function of physiology, cognitive style, and output efficiency. I'm more wasteful in sprint/spike mode. Otoh, I both hate planning and am inefficient/chafing in working to one.

So I end up solving for minimal energy use/least resistance by a) adopting a highly improv style b) building in lots of time for everything, so I can figure things out by trial and error in a *relaxed* unhurried way. I like to iterate, but not fast.

A preference for improv over planning is about narrowing the uncertainty band (improv uses more up-to-date info) but also about limiting rework energy (since waterfall plans need higher-energy reworking when they fail, where improv is typically just 1-step backtrack)

This seems like a good mathematical version of it https://twitter.com/neuroecology/status/1305575411569618946

I like Boyd's version, which is more positive/generative than my own https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1305575623100825601

I’m always curious about how people turn complex utility functions into simple behavioral heuristics. For example, catching a ball in a sort is arg_max_(running trajectory){P(catch the ball(running trajectory)

The way people solve it is “run to keep ball at constant angle”

The solution to “regulate uncertainty within this band” seems to be “don’t make a plan with more than n high-uncertainty actions in sequence”

The act of padding with delays is to break up fragile action sequences.

So if n=2

“Drive to airport” —> “Get through security” —> “Board plane” 

turns into

“Drive to airport” —> “Get through security” —> “Wait around 10-60 minutes” —> “Board plane”

There’s actually a set of uncertainty reducing behaviors. One of mine is “don’t drive unless you must,” since I don’t enjoy it much and tend to make time-stress mistakes like missing exits. So taking transit or uber turns high uncertainty action into low.

Thinking more about this, the reason uncertainty regulation is so important is that its flip side, failure, can have immediate consequences. If you have an accident driving to the airport you have to deal with it. You can’t defer the consequences. Failures are potential forks.

Some failures are containable. If you schedule an hour to debug a program and fail, you can say “I’ll take another shot at this next week” and go on to other things. But it’s hard even when it’s possible. Failure drains energy and you want to warn it back immediately.

If you continue debugging for another hour, you don’t lose the sunk cost of getting situation awareness for that coding session. If you kick it to next week you can’t just pick up where you left off. You have to reboot. Pay the situation awareness cost again.

So regulating uncertainty is about containing failure forks. Adding slack helps with this.  

Parallel uncertainty is worse but rare in personal decision-making.

Hmm. Alt formulation: “keep the number of forks/futures you have to consider in time period T non-trivially below n”

The branching factor of a time interval

One way to manage uncertainty is to expend a lot of energy to control all sources of uncertainty in the environment. This is the rapid monopoly growth strategy of unicorn companies. Commodity your complements, acquire all competition,  buy up supply and distribution.

For individuals, this translates to get rich/fu$. Money is energy in modernity.

Two more accessible (and in many ways more interesting) strategies that can work with limited budgets are robustness (simplify/minimalize life) and adaptability (reorient OODA loop faster)

Robustness or antifragility (distinction is irrelevant here) both attack uncertainty potential of modernity by striving for locally Lindy simplicity.

Waldenponding and other defensive postures are uncritical special cases of this.

All sacrifice performance for robustness.

Adaptability is the most interesting. You just try to think harder and faster. Get inside the OODA loop of the environment to pwn it rather than either dominate it or retreat from it.

Those are the 3 broad strategies for uncertainty regulation: spend more,  do less, think harder

Each strategy has merits, but only the last one can make life steadily more interesting and continue the infinite game. The first two define winnable games and try to win them. If you fail, you’re destroyed. If you succeed, you’re in an arrested development cul de sac.

In last one: You view life as an asymmetric guerrilla warfare challenge.

Kissinger’s “The conventional army loses if it does not win. The guerrilla wins if he does not lose” principle.

Big upside of this is that you stay interested and interesting in the world. Not win+exit.

Any uncertainty regulation strategy that looks like win+exit is a kind of acting dead.

You can’t actually win against the universe in the end. We all die. Do you want to explore as much of it as you can in the time you have? Or hit a win condition and sit around feeling empty?

This might be the lesson of the Cobra Kai show.

## 52. Nerdos vs Thymos

*September 21, 2020*

If something is worth doing for free, it’s worth doing nerd-out obsessively-compulsively for free.

“Free” implies the purest kind of surplus leisure energy. It should be unshackled from ordinary ROI thinking. You’ve *already* accepted zero returns. So why hold back?

I don’t mean doing it with excellence. Excellence only applies to non-free things. It’s a point on a price performance curve. 

True free things (not free samples or loss leaders or freemium or charity) don’t belong on that curve.

Nerd-OCD = qualitatively absurd level of caring.

Anybody who would only do something comparable for money should react like “I wouldn’t put that much effort into this if I were being paid a million dollars”

Money cannot but nerd-OCD levels of caring about a thing. In fact it will discourage it. You’d be caring too much.

Note that we’re NOT talking talent, genius, or exceptional intelligence being inputs. Only demented, quixotic levels of caring, and irrationally absurd levels of time/attention investment but with perfectly ordinary abilities.

This is why most examples are from things like fan theories or hobby projects. Domains where talent is not expected, ROI-logic is suspended by default, and the work is its own reward.

Labor of love stuff, but love is the wrong word.

Psychologically what’s going on is that you’ve triggered a network effect in your head that generates seemingly limitless reserves of attention and engagement with the subject. That’s nerd-OCD. You become a perpetual motion machine of sorts.

The Greeks called it “nerdos” and feared it. It’s where we get the word “nerd.” 🤓

They feared it because they knew it was more powerful than “thymos” and will-to-power 😎

That’s why they tried to ban it. Nerdos was viewed as devil energy in the Middle Ages.

That’s why we have sayings like “the devil hides in the details” or “an idle mind is the devil’s workshop.” 

Religious fear of ocd-nerd energy that trashes ROI formulas, the concept of money, and the supposed value of striving for recognition in thymos contests.

## 53. Societies Evolve to Normalize Psychopathic Self-Presentation

*September 26, 2020*

Observation: psychopaths are often charming/reassuring and can put you at ease in a trusting, vulnerable state.

Hypothesis A: Psychopaths learn to fake norms of trustworthiness and reassurance

Hypothesis B: Societies evolve to normalize psychopath behaviors as norms for all

B is very intriguing. What if all is non-psychos pick up highly manipulative behaviors as “polite and considerate” behavior via imitation of powerful psychopaths? And so all societies have psychopathic cultures of manners as their UX?

Many of the actual kindest and most trustworthy people I know are ill-mannered. Not in the sense of being pointlessly rude or sadistic, but rough, uncouth, and ill-at-ease even in their own milieus. They can’t put others at ease.

Entertaining thoughts is fun. I guess why they call it entertaining. Building on that maybe I should host a party for thoughts, serve them alcohol (which I’d have to drink of course since they live in my head)

Okay, just thought up a pretty robust case for B that this margin is too small to contain. I’m upgrading it to working hypothesis.

Logging interesting exchange with @aresnick https://twitter.com/aresnick/status/1310205567085031424?s=21

Obv this is a subtweet thread of shit going on I can’t share publicly. 

My entire writing career is an extended subtweet. My memoirs should be titled “Subtweeting the Universe”

Yep. Adverse selection ftw. https://twitter.com/Laeeth/status/1310285867202867202

Trying on 2 summary aphoristic versions of the hypotheses for size

A: Sufficiently advanced psychopathy/sociopathy is indistinguishable from good manners

B: Civilization is the process of turning sociopathy into good manners

B strikes me as more true

Oh shit just realized @kimballscott 2x2 fits right into this theory. Ruinous empathy and manipulative insincerity are right next to each other and if you can’t tell real/fake “care personally” apart, they’ll look the same to you.

If you have low self-awareness you won’t be able to tell them apart even on yourself, and mistake your own manipulative insincerity for empathy. In the zone in between it may be ruinous for others but advantageous for you.

This is a tempting conclusion to draw but us actually survivorship bias. If you don’t actually successfully resist a manipulation attempt you might *never* realize it. This is one way redpilling works: revealing your manipulated condition to yourself. https://twitter.com/tdoggyholhol/status/1310289947572736001

Subconscious = known unknown (“something is wrong here/spider sense tingling”)

Unconscious = you register the data necessary to draw the right conscious conclusion but don’t actually do so, and might never do so. Doesn’t need repression. Just failure to think it through.

## 54. Modernism as Aliveness to Change

*September 28, 2020*

We need a  verb meaning “doing science” in elemental, non-institutional, non-bureaucratic sense. Something like “investigating”

Not “research” since that’s overloaded with methodological baggage from professionalized publication-oriented science.

Small-s, no exclamation point.

Investigating has the right energy but points to something more like detective work. Something you do when there’s already a body in the library.

Sciencing in the Matt Damon sense (“science the shit out of it”) is too instrumental.

Connotations needed:

Open-ended trial and error
Conscientiousness
Flow
Patience
Empiricism
Phenomenological bias
Instrument-making
Tracking/stalking/hunting
Increasing precision
Element of play, but serious
Uncertainty
But not much risk
Pre-social
Pre-textual
Pre-mathematical

I’ve been in this state for a while. It feels like larping 17th century early science. I’m literally fiddling with pendulum clocks and simple telescopes like Galileo. It’s a whole mood.

It needs a mansion and money to do right. Or a secure position in the clergy.

I get now why so many early age-of-science pioneers were clergymen. It’s the perfect situation. All the resources of a powerful institution behind you, and it supplies basic needs and expects only poverty and piety.

There’s a sense of being out of time and no pressure to get anything done by a certain time. The opposite of a publish-perish treadmill. “If it’s going to take 50 years it will take 50 years” headspace.

And no, not tinkering/making/hacking. That’s engineering.

I’m doing bits of engineering, but it’s means, not the end. I’m not in a mood to build stuff for its own sake. Building stuff to do this verb. Like prosthetic-powered mindfulness. A kind of transhumanism actually, but for seeing/measuring powers, not doing powers.

A definition popped into my head late last as I was falling asleep: “Modernism is aliveness to change.”

Science is kinda the art of being modern. Modernism comprehends and embraces change without theorizing it into a progress narrative.

In my headcanon, “moderning” captures what I’m after, but it would be confusing to use here. Moderning as a kind of outward-oriented living in the present, rather than inner/spiritual. Not the historical era of 1920s, but the presentist sensibility.

Trying to be modern is a pretty simple idea. It just means living in the present as opposed to the past, future, or adjacent possible. It means aliveness to change because the present is the fastest changing temporality. Past, future, adjacent possible change much more slowly.

Metaphor: in a moving train, if you’ve ever peeked through the gap in the vestibule connecting cars, you see the track sleepers running rapidly below your feet. That’s the present. If you look out of the window, ahead or behind, that’s future and past. Sideways=adjacent possible.

Aliveness to change beyond your immediate person is pretty hard, hence instruments. You can’t just meditate on it like it’s your own breath.

If you wanted to actually see the sleepers on the tracks whizzing by under your feet, it’s not trivial.

Keeping up with twitter feed is aliveness to change

Trying to photograph Jupiter by stacking frames of a short movie (my next astrophotography project) is like keeping up with the raw Jupiter-twitter feed.

I’m not seriously looking for a verb btw, though thanks for the suggestions. Looking for a verb is merely the Macguffin powering this theory of science as modernism as aliveness to change.

Somehow “science” got wrapped up in the identity performance of “intelligent” as a career.

Sure, intelligence makes you particularly good at this in a way that can be parlayed into fame and wealth etc., but the fit with intelligence is almost the least interesting thing about it. Some fairly stupid people have wonderfully scientific sensibilities and ways of seeing.

Learning is definitely part of it for a lot of people, but probably not for me. I’m a bad learner and it’s not a motivator for me. https://twitter.com/starsandrobots/status/1310696012642684930

I wrote this post in 2010 (riffing on the work of artist Amy Lin) on a concept I called “the ancient eye” that gets more at the sense I’m after here. Paradoxically moderning is about developing this ancient eye. https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/03/23/amy-lin-and-the-ancient-eye/

Yeah testing is part of it too, in the sense of testing the boundaries of your own experience, rather than bureaucratic falsification or verification. https://twitter.com/richggall/status/1310701488730247168

Sure, Galileo tested Aristotelean realities when he turned a telescope skyward, but THAT test was not the point. It was just an effect. The real test was of the boundary of the experience of seeing. With an instrument.

“Oh that’s NOT a point of light, it’s a striped ball”

Some accounts of early science make it seem almost like Galileo’s heresies were about him choosing to fight church orthodoxy. No that was just a side effect. If you *wanted* to fight the church in medieval Europe you’d do something more direct, like nailing 99 theses to a door.

Yeah experiments too... another elemental concept that’s somehow gotten bureaucratized into NSF-Approved Hypothesis-Testing Methodology. But yeah. https://twitter.com/Lauracsc_/status/1310705247883591680

Note to self: do not use words as thread macguffins. Derails thread into isntthisjustism.

Grokking in the original Heinlein sense comes pretty close. Insight but into something outside of yourself. Except as the result of steady, patient effort. A gradual dawning of a light via a systematic uncovering of a path rather than a sudden enlightenment.

‘Study’ is probably the best simple English word if you don’t want to get too weird. https://twitter.com/epithetos/status/1310695313322184704?s=21

Paulo Coelho’s Alchemist gets at an aspect of the scientific sensibility that is often lost in modern views. That sense of a gradually dawning, cleansing, purifying light as you get closer to the essence of a thing. I especially like the alchemy connotation.

It’s no accident that early scientists were often also astrologers and occultists. Not only is that acceptable within the scope of the verb I’m circling, it’s necessary. Superstition is inseparable from this kind of questing and not only not a threat to it, but possibly an aid.

If you see a strong distinction between science and superstition that must be policed to keep the former “pure” and “uncorrupted” you’re paradoxically being superstitious about the essence of science. Overanxious policing of science/superstition boundary is bureaucratism.

The Hindi/Sanskrit word saadhna is another useful one with no English equivalent. Learning/study as a mindful spiritual quest. It’s often applied to learning the fine arts. The alchemist’s pursuit was saadhna. Sciencing as a developmental journey similar to learning music.

And this is why I need a mansion. To do science, one must have money, and a mansion of one’s own.

## 55. Caring About Money

*October 10, 2020*

It really is very hard to care about money past the point it stops being a source of immediate anxiety. People capable of caring enough to solve for money past their personal anxiety point have a kind of superpower. It might even be the defining trait of entrepreneurs.

If you stop worrying at say 10k in the bank, but need 100k in non-personal funds to start a project, being able to care enough to go after it (as opposed to caring enough about the thing you intend to do with it) is a superpower. It’s not enough to want it as a means to an end.

Past trivial amounts, money is tricky enough to make that you have to care about it as an end in itself. The instrumental relationship to money breaks down at edges of paycheck band (~14-150k). Below, it looks like magic. Above, it gets gamified (stock comp starts to dominate).

I don’t think this is an accident. Paychecks = middle-class. The value of money evolves to get calibrated so that the instrumental band of complexity of making it coincides with average intelligence and lifestyle anxiety levels.

If the middle class is ever forced to to think non-instrumentally about money, which means being outside the game enough to see it and play it with a bit of meta cognitive mindfulness, but not so much outside that you stop caring entirely, it goes full Kanye.

For the really poor, below the poverty line, money is advanced technology indistinguishable from magic. Getting any feels like divine beneficence. The attitude towards money is a dull, chronic anxiety punctuated by cash crises that are resolved via social means, not directly.

For the middle class, money is not distinguishable from the instrumental recipes they have learned to make it. You crank this handle 40 hours a week, paychecks come out the other end. It’s mostly financial apathy punctuated by the occasional acute anxiety attack.

These anxiety attacks are solved with some mix of formal institutional debt, one-off hacks, and the occasional windfall. Where the poor stay beholden you friends and family in webs they often hate, the middle class gets beholden to institutions via scripted, ceremonialized debt.

But for those able to transcend the instrumental view of money, it becomes possible to make way more than dictated by your anxiety levels. This means setting up money-spinning engines that break the effort-reward correlation characteristic of middle-class money-making recipes.

This is not “passive income” so much as “live money.”

I’m pretty bad at it. Most of my income is tied to effort-reward recipes. It’s not as deterministic as paychecks, but it’s still instrumental recipes not engines. Maybe 5% is from the engines at most.

New goal is to increase that 5% to maybe 15-20%. True leisure time is only created in correlation to live money. No matter how leveraged, effort correlated recipe money, dead money, can’t spin off true leisure.

Live money/dead money is basically like live player/dead player.

It’s only live money if you can buy you Monday morning leisure time. Dead money effort recipes can only buy you evening-and-weekend leisure time. Cognitively speaking, the dregs of attention.

And it’s only leisure activity if nothing critical or financially anxiety-provoking is riding on the outcome. If you make money off it, it’s true “free money” in psychological accounting. Free money is of course even better than live money. It’s more than live. It’s living free.

Live-and-free money is not earned with intention and instrumental effort (dead money) or collected as a rent (live but not free money). It’s the best money because it’s a genuine surplus from freely undertaken leisure behaviors. It’s the money you’ll feel happiest spending.

## 56. Doing Only 1 Thing

*October 14, 2020*

Prioritization is the communism of attention management 😖

Do or do not. There is no priority.

Once you make a list of things that need doing, and prioritize them according to any metric at all, you can guarantee you will want to do something that’s not in the list at all.

I have never once in my life actually worked down and through a prioritized list, though I’ve often made them.

Every prioritized list for me is simple a reverse-neglect order.

I can only do things in my peripheral vision

How to hit the bulls eye.

Step 1: throw the dart
Step 2: paint the bulls eye

This tweet is true, but the dark side is that there are days I fall into the prioritization trap and do zero things instead of 1 thing. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1249913645376524289

Some days I do end up doing multiple things, but only when I’m being driven by other people’s priorities. And then it wipes me out. Left to my own devices I’m on the 1 thing/day plan. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1279258375088271360

I did 1 thing on my own initiative today, and 2 small client things that didn’t require any initiative on my part. The scarce commodity is initiative I think. Reactive autopilot is merely draining, since it uses an existing fixed orientation or borrowed orientation.

So to say you can only do 1 thing per day is to say you can only bootstrap an orientation on your own once per day. I’m currently on 1/day, but when younger I could do 3-4/day. Without even taking a nap.

Manager time vs maker time is a special case. A manager doing 4 one-hour things and a maker doing one 4-hour thing are both likely in a single orientation throughout. Most managers only have a single “business” orientation. They run through several *situations* between breaks.

Real breaks are the “tells” of reorientation. A nap is the most extreme reset.

One way Covid has been hard on me is that my reset breaks used to be location changes. No third place means no second wind in a day.

Orientation = new wind 🤔

I can’t even do a little mid-day loop walk these days because of heat and pollution. 

And the “gym” instead of being a pleasant break is an annoying reconfiguration of bedroom (we have a weight bench and bowflex weights but it’s in a cramped space that takes some confit to useO

Considering the cycling thing some life hacker types do, where for 3 weeks you’re mainly on one project. Hard to do around consulting since that’s unpredictable demand. 

My work-week is 2 days earmarked for writing 2 newsletters and 3 open days.

1-2 of those days are typically consulting, so typically I only have 1 day a week to do pure initiative things

(writing is not reactive, but is not full-stack orientation either, more like half-stack)

Hmm. Context switching and reorientation might be one of the main affordances of public and communal spaces. If everybody is trapped indoors, general reorientation rates go way down. Public = quadruple jeopardy right now: covid, heat, pollution, trumpism.

## 57. Long-Term Thinking https://t.co/C07axDIO9R

*October 24, 2020*

long-term thinking makes people unhappy because it almost necessarily means they’re thinking about big problems

the only future thing you can be fairly sure about is that the big problems of today won’t go away miraculously and will last as long as you expect, probably longer

almost every problem people were worried about in the 80s when I was first taught to worry professionally like an adult is still there and has gotten worse exactly as predicted

- overpopulation
- water scarcity
- global warming 

only exception is ozone hole which may come back

people do “happy” long-term thinking by building positive potential in the form of very general capabilities, like the internet

downside is general potentialities never solve specific big problems, merely reshape them

sometimes the reshaping makes them harder, sometimes easier

nuclear proliferation is still a problem, just a bigger, more chaotic one https://twitter.com/bpettichord/status/1319820994870169601

the leap of faith people make about working in generic capabilities rather than solutions to real problems (notice I *didn’t* scare-quote real) is that on average they’ll reshape more problems to be easier than harder, and so faster than more problems get added to the stack

so if in 1980 there were 10 level 4 problems the hope is a general capability will bump 7 of them down to level 3 and bump 3 of them up to level 5

problem load reduction: 4*10-3*7-3*5=40-21-15=4

but then another level 4 problem might have been added in the meantime

update it’s back 🤣 

I hadn’t checked lately https://twitter.com/RaqWinchester/status/1319826561944739840

roslingism isn’t wrong, it’s just misconstrued, it shows that problems are in fact being reshaped and mitigated due to new potentialities, so indeterminate optimism is warranted

the problem is rolling the dice may not solve problem in the priority order we think is necessary https://twitter.com/vr00n/status/1319822543944110080

roslingism is popular with free market types because it works well with markets

everything will be fixed once the price is right

the problem is the price and time may not be right at the same time

the market is just 1 mechanism in play, possibly the only one, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessary or sufficient for any given problem to get solved right at the right time, so that’s where i part ways with market fetishists who won’t entertain the possibility of alt mechanisms

other mechanisms, including state action and nonprofit action also reshape problems in unexpected ways, but it’s harder to make the leap of faith that on balance they’ll have a net positive effect

that doesn’t mean they’re off the table, just more subject to hostile scrutiny

the big problem with state and nonprofit mechanisms is that their fans won’t admit that they have as much or worse indeterminacy and externalities built into their operation

there is an illusion of determinate agency around them

the stronger the illusion, the worse the effects

the older I get, the less of a stake I feel in big problems because the likelier it is they’ll stay stable/slowly degrading in my lifetime, and the easier it is to focus on my own narrower interests, and at most concern myself with general potentialities over specific mechanisms

one way I like to reduce this to individual mediocre human scale is to ask what’s at the intersection of effectiveness and non-misery at every life-stage?

unlike Chosen Ones™ mediocre humans can’t be effective while miserable (though they needn’t be actually happy)

more to the point why bother? 

non-misery gives mediocre people something to fight to protect, giving them a reason to be part of the solution rather than the problem, and without coercion

Chosen Ones™ are different for whatever reason

maybe they are geniuses, or were bullied as kids, it doesn’t matter...

you can model them as psychohistorical mules, random anomalous events that seed positive or negative potentialities that reshape the Big Problems Stack™

mediocre people I think should simply try to keep personal misery at bay, but in a broad-minded way, and differently at every life stage, reflecting the stakes of every stage, because if you’re miserable and not a Chosen One™ you’re almost certainly part of the problem

0-18 your best bet is probably skills development

19-35 probably long-term thinking because you have the positivity of youth to overcome the the negativity burden

36-50 probably support/catalyze positive potentials that are developing in your lifetime

50+... ask me after 2024.

turning 46 in a few weeks, definitely on the leeward slope of life in my head, almost certainly more life behind me than in front of me

neither a part of the problem nor part of the solution to anything, but hopefully a net non-negative presence in the world

to bring it back around, I can’t really think in time horizons any more, short or long, but I do think in terms of temporal textures like lucky/unlucky timelines, and in terms of transforming bad textures into good ones, or poisonous moods into non-poisonous ones

maybe mood alchemy is the capability that interests me

Gen X appears 10 years younger than it is because our prime decade fell through the cracks between the death of old media and the rise of social media. 1995-2005, the missing life decade. https://twitter.com/skyler__adams/status/1319845329550725120?s=21

We are the undocumented digital migrants 🤣

Though I totally coasted through that decade doing absolutely nothing worthwhile so it’s fair to edit it out

## 58. Wealth and Protocols

*October 31, 2020*

You can comfortably shake hands with anyone between 0.5x to 2x your height, but beyond that, it starts to get tricky. If people’s heights were in proportion to even log of their wealth, I would not be able to shake hands with Bill Gates. He’s in the 10^11 range and I’m in 10^5 🤔

Social harmony presumes more than just soft personality traits like consideration and empathy. It presumes some impedance matching for basic interactions. Handshakes are often a metaphor for technical protocols, not just social.

Like you can’t connect 5-12v dc electronics to 110-240V ac supplies without a transformer. Something would blow. A transformer is an embodied handshake protocol.

If you’ve ever socially interacted with people vastly wealthier or vastly poorer than you, you’ll notice that things break at the mechanical protocol level even before you get to seeing each other as human and practicing empathy etc.

Research (Sapolsky etc) says being at the bottom of a hierarchy is stressful, and this is true, but only within an impedance matched band. In a bank office party, a teller making 50k will experience stress talking to the investment banker making 500k. 1-point band on a log scale.

But at a log band of 2 (wealth, power or any other hierarchy variable)or higher, it’s not stressful, just plain confusing and clumsy protocol wise. And it’s not about table manners and stuff, it’s just a completely alien headspace. You look similar but are from different species.

That’s a long-winded way to a point that solving for social harmony conditions across impedance mismatched bands is not even wrong. Which is one reason I have no patience for stuff like “civil debate”. It’s all in-band stuff and fails at bands wider than 2 on a log scale.

Took me unreasonably long to see this, because I was distracted by the red herring of the ethics/morality of harmony-solving. It’s simpler than that. Harmony is a band-relative (and culture-relative, but that’s not relevant for this thread) concept. You can only solve locally.

As a Myers-Briggs INTP, I have what’s known as Fe: extroverted feeling  tendencies, which makes me instinctively/unconsciously try to solve for harmony even when that’s a meaningless, counterproductive thing to do. That’s perhaps why it took me longer to see this.

Ever notice what happens when you solve for harmony across too wide an impedance band? 

You get theater.

Like trying to talk to a much wealthier or poorer person about money. Your experiences of money are too far apart for harmonious discourse.

An example of this is the Friends episode where they go out for a nice dinner and the 3 poor friends (Joey, Rachel, Phoebe) order cheap items, the rich ones (Ross, Monica, Chandler) order pricey things, and Ross casually suggests splitting check evenly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYb9jnt2cv4

Within a band, this would be an innocent suggestion. Across 2 bands, where one group is acutely conscious of, and focused on, something the other subgroup is barely conscious of, this is a setup for harmony rupture.

But notice what broke: not table manners, but a shared sense of justice. The 3 rich friends assumed an even split was just because errors were below their indifference level.

Play this out another way. What if rich friends had tried to solve for harmony while conscious of gap?

Theater: they’d have gone to a cheap restaurant and pretended to share lower-class tastes, while the poorer friends would have either pretended not to notice.

OR:

They’d have split by what people’s orders cost, and the finicky math would have highlighted the inequality.

OR the rich friends could have just paid for the other 3.

There is NO way to solve for harmony here that does not involve pretense/preference falsification or making mismatches legible, switching the dynamic to a status/hierarchical one (patronage, loaded gift etc)

Think of society as a matrix of class and culture. Some notion of functional harmony is both possible and effective within a sing,e cell. Across 2 adjacent cells you get theater or superior/subordinate dynamics. With 3 cells band you basically get confusion.

You can do ceremonies across 3 or more bands but no real problem solving is possible beyond a theatrical pass-me-the-salt level. Again note that we’re talking fundamental breaks, not cosmetic ones like using the wrong fork or missing a cultural reference.

Cosmetic breaks are irrelevant. They make for social awkwardness and cringe, but don’t really get in the way. One side can learn the other’s culture of manners. You can fake knowledge of references. But deep protocol breaks can’t be smoothed away that way.

“Split check evenly” is a handshake that only works when people have matched standards of what amount of money is in the indifference band (modulo individual differences like a Scroogey millionaire who pinches pennies). You can’t fix it with a finishing school teaching fork use.

A huge proportion of culture war problems today are due to pretending deep protocol problems are either cosmetic or a matter of morals/ethics. Hence misdirected efforts at civil debate etc.

I’m not sure what the solution is. But it’s clear what happens when the problem is mischaracterized. You have the human social equivalents of electric arcing, short circuits, fires, etc. The *best* case outcome is a blown fuse and a blackout.

A useful starting point might be to distinguish 2 kinds of social mobility: life situation mobility (relocating across classes and/or cultures) versus “tourist” mobility (being able to visit/problem solve across “harmony cells” so to speak).

To be continued, I have more to say.

I included an unnecessary Myers-Briggs poison pill specifically to ward off a particular subculture of harmony seekers 🤣

The opposite of my temperament, Introverted Feeling (Fi) btw, has what they think is a solution: causing what I think of as “values scenes” https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1322674148984844288

MBTI language is convenient but not necessary to think this through. It has a positive side-effect of turning off statistics-rationalists

If Fe is futile harmony theater, Fi is an irregular verb: “I’m behaving with integrity, you’re moral posturing, he’s causing a useless scene”

A “values scene” is somebody breaking a harmony theater (often accising others of hypocrisy) and strutting around causing a scene, while sermonizing about how they’re not going to compromise their integrity. It’s as futile as the harmony theater. https://youtu.be/Uwapf5DnUrs?t=170

## 59. Occupying Both Sides of a Conversation

*November 23, 2020*

People really like to have both sides of conversations. You’d think this is a sort of stylized performance element but it isn’t. Many people have a real style that a,punts to: have both sides of a conversation, get mad when live counterparty goes off script, to force them back on https://twitter.com/commiefairie/status/1330386159176982529

It’s like a telemarketer script but with every alternate layer modeling their response being a Procrustean bed:

Q: Have you thought about wage theft?

A1: [Procrustean bed 1]
A2: [Procrustean bed 2]

Q2.1: [GET BACK ON THAT BED!]

Q2.2: [GET BACK ON THAT BED!]

A failure mode in any helping profession with a principal-agent asymmetry (lawyers etc) is being so script-locked you can’t hear. Good ones rise above, viewing the (procedurally necessary) script as an eventual compile target rather than a way to confine a free-form conversation.

Where this asymmetry is lacking because there is no significant *procedurally defined* expertise on the helping side (consulting, many types of therapy), the lack of scripted leverage and steering authority can be anxiety provoking. So people make up bullshit processes.

I’m convinced half of all business consulting “process” models are just ways to avoid the real stress of live play sparring conversations. Any actual content in say “lean startup” can be made prerequisite pre-reads so the actual conversation can stay unscripted.

A lot of things that aren’t really education get cast in educational molds simply to provide conversational control. The OP is an obvious example. It’s indoctrination pretending to be education. A lot of business “courses” fall into the same trap *cough* lean six sigma *cough*

If you do solve the problem in the immediate conversation, you still have to solve it one degree removed. In consulting, you are forced to operate on the evidence of one side of the story: your client’s. And immature ones will often report stylized scripts+diffs.

The “data” of the consult will be one-sided highly unreliable hearsay reports of conversations *they*had. Unconsciously these reports will have 

a) caricaturing of counterparty
b) consistency editing removing the revealing glitches
c) embellishments to make themselves look good

It’s not a court so you can’t get testimony from other side.

They’re unconsciously looking for validation but if you cave and supply it, you’re useless and they’ll eventually realize it and end the gig

You can’t cross-examine like they’re a hostile witness: you’re on their side

This problem is hard. My solution is to...

1. Only work with people mature enough to be above this dynamic, or to at least want to be above it

2. Work long-term (> 4-5 meetings over 6 months) so you can reinforce better self-witnessing behaviors

The way this works is: when somebody reports a scripted-sounding conversation ask diagnostic questions they’d only know answers to if they were listening in free-play mode”

Eg:

Client: “I called him out on project delays but he just made excuses”

Me: “what’s on his plate?”

If they can’t answer, you simply set conversation-data aside as insufficient/incomplete and say “maybe we can table this item until you’ve had a chance to talk with them again and figure X out”

It’s an informal version of disallowing inadmissible evidence. Or down-weighting it.

For a sufficiently mature person, a word to the wise is sufficient. They instantly get why hearsay of anything other than properly witnessed free-play conversations is basically noise as consulting input. Or that at best it reveals stuff about projection tendencies.

Once you get it it seems like a superpower.

“Oh wow you can actually use conversations to discover new info if you allow other side to own their side of the conversation. It doesn’t have to be a Sisyphean struggle of hostile universe repeatedly knocking your story off-script.”

People who resist the allure of this discovery potential are attached to the world being the way their scripts validate. They literally want to hear nothing except confirmation. When I sense this (if it gets this far) I tell them they need a therapist not a consultant.

Though usually I can tell from the initial email or exploratory call.

## 60. Good World-Building Needs Peacocking

*November 25, 2020*

Plot and character are in some ways the commodity elements of fiction, and how-to books spend 90% of their words on those. But good genre fiction usually seems to center a non-basic element:

LOTR: fake languages
Culture: names of ships
Star Trek: species

This seems important.

Plot and character are like a platform, but the centered non-basic element (non-basic as in stories can work without them) is the killer app. You don’t need any specific non-basic thing (few works develop fake languages as deeply as LOTR), but you do need some non-basic things.

More examples:

- Harry Potter: “magic physics” (laws governing magical objects/beings)

- Discworld: political science opinions

- Hitchhikers guide: absurdist fragments of history/geography (which is why the Guide is a good prop... a cheap device to hold the fragments)

- Asimov: Laws (the 3 laws, which segue into the laws of psychohistory)

- Le Guin: temporalities

- PKD: simulations?

Note these are not “themes” but ontological first class citizens

I’m looking for non-singleton classes. The improbability drive is a key plot element but the only one of its class. Whereas for eg Harry Potter has dozens of magical objects/beings with laws. https://twitter.com/MangoZeus/status/1331676006134947840

Another way to think about it is: non-basic elements provide a “third way” to start a story:

1. Work out the plot as an outline of beats (plot-driven)

2. Work out the characters as a set of biographical backstories (char driven)

3. Flesh out non-basic element (NBE-driven)

If you wanted to write an HHG pastiche, arguably you should start with a bunch of encyclopedia-type entries

Asimov pastiche: make up your own laws for something

Culture pastiche: make up a class of things that can be given interesting names

I agree these are part of world-building but a subset and importantly, overdeveloped beyond would-building needs. For eg every world needs an ontology and a naming scheme for things, but strategically centering them has an effect beyond just world building. https://twitter.com/emilysuvada/status/1331677349515988994

Perhaps we should call them world-animations. Subsets of world building that, if adequately overdeveloped, turn into engines of plot and character. Ship names are a life-force in Culture but in most books names just “do the job” they have to in world-building and nothing more.

Like J. K. Rowling has fun names too, many of which are sly word play allusions (Durmstrang = Sturm und Drang = character of the school) but they don’t animate the world the way ship names in Culture do. A mere list of ship names evokes a powerful live world for Culture.

In Freudian terms, I’m thinking these core non-basic world-animators are like the id of the world, and worldbuilding is more like superego. 

The plot and character are the ego.

I suspect working the id is the most fun part of the writing for the author. Making up languages was the fun for Tolkien. Making up absurd Guide entries was the fun for Adams.

Why: you can tell they’ve overdone it relative to supporting plot/character or portraying the world.

The “brand” of the work in a marketing sense flows from this id element but cannot be cynically engineered. It has to come from an animating place of genuine fun-having. Authenticity if you will. Proof-of-fun. Costly signal that the author was in an abundant/extravagant mode.

Genre fiction at least (if not literary) I think has to flow from a place of abundance for it to manifest escapist potential that sucks you in. This abundance is costly-signaled by essentially peacocking an element of the world-building to extremes.

I think the secret to Star Wars is actually special effects. As Lucas going on to do ILM reveals. The story is bad, the characters are not fun, and plot relies on Campbell too much as a crutch. But special effects... amazing advance for its time. https://twitter.com/kellydigges/status/1331684943336935424

Nerd-outability as a reader filter. The right kind of reader will add to the source-abundance of the work rather than simply draw sustenance from it. I guess that’s the logic of fan-fiction/fandom. Splillover/surplus effect. https://twitter.com/emilysuvada/status/1331686380750082048

Non-basic id element “incluing” https://twitter.com/kevinmarks/status/1331697608042147846

A good diagnostic question, in the spirit of Alan Kay “waste transistors” principle of personal computing is “what is this story willing to waste?”

What is it willing to feature “too many” of?

Culture = clever names.

More examples:

Futurama: Silly devices/gadgets/design fiction objects

Simpsons: Arguably the couch gags+intro mini-story that triggers the main story, like “they go to the fair and Homer buys 1 dumbbell”

South Park: “we learned something today” faux-morals

Rick and Morty: inter-dimensional cable and quick-sketched useless parallel universes which don’t do anything for the plot, like the farting-asses universe. 

Best example might be the brilliant pizza-universe set. There is NO good reason for this scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUBmEDAoGOE

What to call this principle? Spice-note? https://twitter.com/miniver/status/1331675875947937792

Secret sauce is perhaps too broad. 🤔

This is a narrower animating thing. https://twitter.com/zenpundit/status/1331703351097090055

Big mood? Generator? Flywheel? Root chakra? Idiopathy?

Principle needs a clear statement too: “every successful genre story has an unnecessarily overbuilt world id-element.”

The Rick and Morty example suggests an aspect. Every instance of the id-element suggests the gestalt of entire universe. All other world-elements have to vibe with that gestalt. You can get at this by asking: what is a nominally correct non-element if the set of id-elements?

What’s a ship-name that does NOT fit the Culture universe?

Maybe USS Enterprise?

What’s a language that does NOT fit Middle Earth?

Minion language

What’s a universe that does NOT fit R&M multiverse?

A non-satirical universe maybe? This one is hard

The flywheel aspect is important. One instance of the set should catalyze more instances. It should snowball into a gun game readers want to join in even if they lack the skill. Like ship names. Everybody has fun making up their own. Compound interest. Narrative network effect.

The collectible cards test. Yep. Or can it spawn a fanpedia. https://twitter.com/araskin/status/1331723171087618049

Based on fiction I’ve written so far and enjoyed writing, I think my thing is “philosophy gadgets” — devices that embody an abstraction. Like my strategometer: a watch that indicates when you’re thinking strategically. I have such things in all my stories.

## 61. Data Model Personhood

*December 13, 2020*

AI personhood would be nice, but is a sideshow. What we need is data model personhood. 

Which is kinda the same as instrumentation personhood, since data doesn’t exist until it is measured, and measurements don’t exist without data models derived from instrument models

Example: say a digital home thermometer samples temperature at 100hz via a thermistor. That’s ~80 MB of data a day that rests on the meanings of terms like “Celsius” and “byte”, a sensor curve, etc. Collectively that conceptual model of data is embodied by a long list of numbers.

It’s useful to think of that column of 86,400,000 numbers plus some meta-information is a virtual person attached to the physical device. 

The richer and more varied the data, the more it needs to be digested and summarized in reified models to be legible at all.

Past a point of complexity, the data has to speak for itself via bundled analytics etc. It has to make choices about how to present itself at high level. A stream of data turns into a system’s narrative memory of itself and then data turns into Data.

This may seem silly for a thermometer producing a one-dimensional stream of numbers whose meaning is based on stable physics models, but just peek into say climate data debates around temperature records and you’ll realize how fraught this is... personhood is a way to model that.

Or take something obviously more complex like a Dexa scan. It produces a data ghost of your body. I got one a few years ago. The tech hands you a piece of paper with a drawing of a human silhouette and color coded visualization of your fat distribution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry

In Culture novels, people routinely save entire states of themselves, including memories, that can be used to resurrect them in cloned bodies or as AIs. Im skeptical of “uploading” as a sentience/consciousness preserving process, but the data-agency take on that is a weaker claim

The question then is: who owns data-persons created from your data? You the source of the data? The owners of the instrumentation IP? The owners of the copyright on the data model used to cast physical signals like a current valuation into data?

I think the only solution is: the data owns itself. Just like biological offspring do. Anything else leads to an unholy mess of conflicts of interest, bad faith, etc.

Like children, data persons need parenting until they get “grow up.” But the principle of fostering ontogenic development into full personhood should be the true north. Ideas like “researchers should open-source data and code used to write peer-reviewed papers” are soft versions.

This builds on my idea of boundary intelligence from a while back. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/915302752720322560

See also B. F. Skinner’s famous “On having a poem” lecture where he makes a close analogy between birthing a human and a poem. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PauL2KXagrg

I’m not a data-rights absolutist, and am willing to trade “my”
data for services, but the farther data is along ontogenic path to personhood, the more wary I am of it being locked up. Not “information wants to be free” but “data shouldn’t be in school/jail without good reason” https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1338186168706367488

Galaxy brain version: you’re *already* a data-person yourself. A particular idiosyncratic theory of personhood populated by data streams from about 100-250 lbs of biomass. That you are you is just one opinion about the nature of that mass. https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-an-individual-biology-seeks-clues-in-information-theory-20200716/

## 62. Overactive Cheater Detection

*December 29, 2020*

Overactive cheater detection is at the root of a lot of societal problems. It’s not that people are dumb when acting under biases but that they’re only smart about problems framed as cheater-detection.

You can work on eliminating 100 biases, or just on lowering cheater-response. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1343974533972197376

The thing is, we’re not in a high-scarcity ape-troop environment where detecting and responding to cheating of various sorts is the dominant life problem and ordinary existential threat. Modern societies can tolerate a ton of cheating, from trivial to profound, and survive fine.

We live in a high-abundance, low-threat world, with birth control and consensual basis for most transactions, and most material needs met via cash transactions. That alone, regardless of cheating levels, is a huge change from sneaking around alpha gorilla for food and fucks.

I suspect just two moves, if widely practiced, would start radically rebuilding trust.

1. Preferentially deal with people you do trust
2. Weaken instinct to punish reciprocally*

* tit-for-two-tats over tit-for-tat for you IPD mavens... compensate for complexity-noise

The thing is, the more complex+benevolent an environment, the easier life is, but the less you understand how anything works. That doubt+abundance is like catnip to cheater-detection instincts. They’re firing like crazy, but there is no obvious target you can direct response at.

Since nothing is going wrong to justify a response proportionate to your sense of ongoing unfairness (which is what doubt/uncertainty translates to in a cheater-mindset), you end up massively over-reacting to minor signs of cheating and updating priors wholesale on environment.

This doesn’t mean being gullible, or leaving open opportunistic attack surfaces. Walking around with a “kick me” sign is a bad idea, regardless of abundance. But consider treating cheating as a problem comparable to sewage or trash management. Not as existential threat.

One of the greatest luxuries an abundant society offers is that you can afford to let people get away with stuff up to a point. The fear that you’d be encouraging them is misguided. Every vendor who overcharges you by $1 will not turn into a Trump if left unpunished.

Most cheating is homeostatic. It is on the margins of default non-cheating behavior, and self-regulates. Few people get addicted to a cancerously expanding behaviors of ”let me see just how much I can get away with.” For most, the behavior stops where risk of shame mounts.

A good example is Gavin Newsom vs Donald Trump. Newsom is an ordinary, mediocre politician who cheats in small-to-medium ways (cheating in marriage, the French Laundry incident), but is essentially a socially controllable cheater. Par for the course for politician behavior.

Trump has been such a disaster for trust because he’s a lifelong addict of what-I-can-get-away-with. It’s actually kinda a positive that the system wasn’t designed with people like him in mind. For most, like Newsom, threat of shaming and visible-norms-based checks are enough.

A society designed to prevent Trump-like behaviors would be over-engineered against cheaters. It’s actually fine I think to have someone like him show up, hack the system, and provide a resentment-steam outlet every generation or so.

In any attempt to get to a “new normal” it would be a mistake to lower reliance on norms. When you trust norms, you risk the occasional metastasized cheater mega-event, but your average trust stays high and the average cost of governance stays low.

Norms-based trust, as opposed to trustless verification, catalyzes positive-sum relationships. It’s like free weights over machine. How are you going to learn to trust others and not overreact to cheaters if you never give yourself the chance to learn positive trust patterns?

It’s actually analogous to the core of religious faith. To demand proof of god is to lack faith. To verify everything in society is to trust nothing in society.

It’s healthy to have a sort of religious faith in society, where you risk the occasional Trump by trusting by default.

There’s better ways to signal your lack of gullibility and exploitability than bringing a hostile suspicion to all situations where there’s uncertainty and giving yourself all the benefit of doubt because “everybody is out to get you.”

It’s okay to sometimes give the benefit of doubt to parties besides yourself, *even if they get things wrong often* — bureaucracies, politicians, obtuse customer-service reps, people who think DC is better than Marvel, someone who may have already had a first slice of cake...

It’s okay to be the sucker once in a while so long as you don’t develop a persistent reputation as a sucker (harder than you think). It’s okay to occasionally pay for others’ mistakes.

And it’s dumb to think *you* behave with 100% honesty and intelligence when people trust *you*

The astounding thing about modern civilization is that small-to-medium mistakes and cheats generally don’t kill you or even significantly worsen your life. The only thing that’s easy to damage is your sense of dignity. The main cost of most cheating is the outraged overreaction.

Dignity protection instincts are flip side of over-developed cheater detection cognition. When your entire existence can be put at risk by a small cheat in a scarcity-shaped environment, of course you’ll be primed to kill over small threats to dignity. Reputation is everything.

It’s weird to find myself arguing this, since most of my own reputation is built on making fun of cluelessness and peddling theories of sociopathy, deception, and false consciousness. I’m effectively saying here — *it’s clueless to be over-invested in not being clueless.*

Ie it’s fine to be clueless when there’s little at stake. Does it matter if you, as a dollar-rich American, go to a third-world country and get taken for say $5 due to cluelessness about something, when $5 is a cheap lunch for you and a week of food for the “sociopath cheater”?

The trick is not never being clueless. It is knowing WHEN to activate and use all your cheater instincts to the best of your ability, and to keep those instincts practiced enough to use when needed. Occasional embarrassment from being “taken in” is fine.

“Everything burned down, but at least nobody ever fooled ME”

That’s what things feel like now. And the vibe is strongest among those who believe utterly crackpot things of course. They’re the most certain they’ve beaten the evil demonic cheaters.

Heuristic for non-scarcity societies

Fool me once, maybe it was an honest mistake
Fool me twice, I’ll let you get away with it
Fool me thrice, shame on you
Fool me 4 times, I stop dealing with you
Fool me 5 times, I finally react and it will be effective but not vindictive

Related to cheater detection is pre-emptive rejection of social policies based on overblown fears of extent of cheating. If 1% of people cheat on a welfare scheme, people will believe it is 30%, and during proposal deliberations, will argue like it’s going to be 99%.

## 63. Greedy Benefit-of-Doubt Allocation

*January 7, 2021*

Claiming all benefit of doubt around uncertain events for yourself seems to me to be the original sin in a complex world.

It is fine to place risky bets under uncertainty and enjoy your wins. It’s asserting certainties about the world that turns boldness into corruption.

By which I mean: betting that a fair coin (with a known long-run 50-50 H/T ratio and documented i.i.d behavior over last 1000 tosses, say) will produce 3 heads in a row is risky (1/8th chance) and if you turn $1 into $7.50 by betting that, you’re bold. Enjoy your $6.50.

But...

...if you go on to claim that you’re sure the *next* toss will 100% be heads because mystic magic, and sucker people who don’t know the coin’s demonstrated fair history into giving you money to bet on it, you’re being corrupt.

You could still get away with it (50% chance).

Here a combo of counterparty ignorance of the past, and known uncertainty about the future creates a benefit of doubt allocation problem. 

You can’t stop people believing strange things but you can avoid cashing out all doubt for yourself by lying about reality as *you* see it.

Many made money on prediction markets by betting against irrational Trump bets in recent weeks. This is fine. Congrats on separating suckers from $. It’s people who knowingly continue to feed false certainties by cashing out doubt in self-serving ways who strike me as corrupt.

I’m thinking of course of Hawley, Cruz etc. People who are willing to do what Romney called out most clearly — not telling their voters the truth. Not even somebody else’s truth. *Their* truths. 

There’s always doubt and uncertainty. The issue is who benefits from it.

The test of both intelligence and ethics is whether you are willing to tolerate a difference between your private allocation of doubts and your public allocation.

Extreme case: parent is 100% certain there is no Santa, but acts 100% certain there is when talking to 4-year old.

Cruz, Hawley etc. are indulging in Santa-lies to adults to carve up electoral empire being left behind by Trump.

If you actually believe there was widespread fraud, you’re just an idiot. 

If you act like you believe, to gain power over idiots who do believe... you’re corrupt.

Again, we’re not talking certainties. It’s an uncertain world and there is always doubt. There’s a one in a billion chance the fraud case is true. There’s a one in a trillion chance the moon landings were faked.

Corruption is acting like these are more likely than not. 51%+

We live in an uncertain world, but find it harder to say “I’m not sure” than “I was wrong.”

It’s harder to live in uncertainty than to even assert wrongness. Because acting 10p% certain of *anything* including your own wrongness, looks brave.

People respond to any sign of greater certainty than events actually permit or that they themselves feel. This is a believe-in-Santa impulse. People would rather believe that *maybe* this confident parental-proxy figure knows something that lowers the uncertainty. Wishful trust.

I admire the technical sophistication of those who make bold bets, win, visibly survive and develop a nice winning record of calling-it-right bets. But event outcomes are not truths. Sucker exploits are not proofs. Prowess is admirable but integrity takes more.

Feeding the mythology of your own unusual win record to turn it into a charisma of unreasonable rightness... the self-congratulatory self-authoring tendencies based on attribution bias... it now strikes me as moral corruption, not just shallow vanity.

The thing is, projecting an air of greater certainty about how the world works brings benefits *beyond* the wins of the immediate prediction/betting game it may rest on. Making a selfish gran for those benefits at the expense of the quality of others beliefs... corruption.

There are perhaps benevolent cases. Pretending Santa is real for eg.

There are even cases where you might in fact really know things others don’t, but merely exaggerate them (eg product visionaries projecting reality distortion fields and crafting personal myths)

But in general, when I see people being more righteously certain than events merit, my priors point to corruption, not special knowledge.

I think people mostly do this unconsciously. Risk taking leads to self-talk to boost felt certainty and lower courage needs.

You want to take a 1 in 10 shot. You only have enough courage for a 1 in 2 risk. So you talk confidently, get others betting with you, misrepresent the risks both to actually reduce it for yourself and gain some courage from social proof kool-aid. You’re socializing your risks.

How often do you see people say openly, “this is a wild outlier bet, but I’m making it anyway because I’m tempted by the upside; don’t follow me unless you want to be as crazy as me”

Adults don’t tell adults lies about how certain the world is unless they want to exploit them. It’s a form of dehumanizing contempt that unfortunately works as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Tell a captive audience of adults “Santa is real” long enough, they’ll turn into children.

I didn’t enjoy that attempted recent takedown of Taleb. I think it was a tedious misfire. Taleb’s real corruption lies in his posture of confident halo-effect certainty which goes against every actual cogent point he’s made, which would recommend a humble, no-Santa-lies posture.

Basically, the Golden Rule for a complex, uncertain world is this: perform the actual uncertainty you feel about the world. Don’t knowingly act more certain than you feel.

Unless you’re talking to children or mentally/physically injured adults who need some temporary kindness.

(the converse risk also exists: sandbagging, or acting *less* certain than you feel, but is IMO less of a catalyst for corruption because it is self correcting — the first time you sandbag, people learn to see through your bluff)

Gonna leave you with a pointer to Irving Goffman’s classic On Cooling the Mark Out. Which is the challenge facing any principled republicans who want to end this rather than drag out the now cancerously long con. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00332747.1952.11022896

Footnote: irony and humor are the most enriching ways to alloy apparently self-certain assertions with enough uncertainty to make them not-corrupt. You will notice that corrupt people tend to use humor backwards: to inflate certainty. The laughs come easier but truths get harder.

Footnote 2: If you can’t/don’t do humor and irony, at least do those “epistemic status” nutritional labels like the earnest rationalists do.

Footnote 3: Sarcasm, mockery, amirite humor are all backwards-humor genres (inflate certainty rather than moderate it). Avoid.

## 64. Aesthetics as the Entry Drug of Conservatism

*January 16, 2021*

aesthetics seems to be the entry drug of conservatism everywhere in the world 🤔

doesn’t matter what kind; any kind of primary concern with beauty seems to do the trick

if the first question you ask about anything centers aesthetics, you’ll get more conservative over time, but if any other concern typically tops it you’ll get more liberal over time

lifelong trends in either direction are more interesting than at any given time, or sharp horseshoe jumps, and concern with aesthetics tends to accurately flag that secular tendency early on

‘any other concern’ need not be consistent even for a single person

so long as something other than aesthetics is your primary concern 51% of the time you’ll tend to drift off the natural conservatism vector

it’s a kind of existential distractibility from beauty

this is how all non-conservative philosophies begin

it’s not that I’m uninterested in aesthetics, it’s just that I’m easily distracted from exploration of it, and am not particularly distressed by lack of it

I learned to get along with most conservatives when I figured this out 

just recognize when they’re talking about aesthetics in disguised form, and nod along

check back in when they stop

weird conflicts start if you try to engage aesthetic concerns with non-aesthetic frames

This idea seems to be either insultingly obvious, obviously wrong, or some sort of redpill for people 🧐

I’d a;ways assumed it’s an idea everybody discovers as a so-honors and then it ages like either wine or vinegar in your head as you age. https://twitter.com/alexqgb/status/1350520998731292672

It’s not intended as bait though I can see why it would seem like it to a certain sensibility. https://twitter.com/sagar__dubey/status/1350539511416164358

I mean something fairly narrow. Just aesthetics as a first-class citizen of cognition (in pathological cases, where it leads to serial killer type behaviors, the *only* first class citizen).

Aesthetics as a *secondary* concern is basically a default human trait. Anyone who claims to be solving for ugliness is either trolling, perversely arguing for a strawman, or hasn’t figured out dissonance as an ordinary element/knob of aesthetics.

Interestingly artists themselves rarely seem to be primarily concerned with aesthetics, let alone the theory of it, at a conscious level. It’s something that falls out of pursuit of some other prime concern, like an idea, theme, emotion, mood etc.

This is a tendency connoisseurs, aesthetes, etc (of any kind, whether of apple pies or wine or paintings or comics) are more likely to exhibit than artists. Many turn into critics or ideologues. But you don’t need to cultivate a refined taste, merely prioritize it in life.

If you’re broaden the definition of “conservative” to anyone invested in traditions with long histories, the claim gets stronger. Eg. the “modern” labor movement is 150 years old. People invested deeply in it tend to be conservative in psychology even if we don’t call them that.

Maybe a less controversial way to say this is people who are primarily concerned with the quality of sensory experiences eventually get invested in some tradition or the other. Tradition becomes their true north in seeking out the quality of sensory experiences they seek.

With high probability, novelty will disrupt quality expectations of sensory experiences. The new tends to be “not even ugly” (by analogy to “not even wrong”).

Novelty is pre-aesthetic. If you’re excited by it, you discard notions of quality and approach it. If not you retreat.

An ongoing conservative project is to either accommodate novelty in a harmoniously expanded understanding of a tradition-linked aesthetic, OR code it as ugly. Both require understanding the tradition more than the novel thing threatening it.

Conservatives are ofyen more courageous than non-conservatives. But they tend to lack a specific narrow variety: The courage to understand the new in its own terms, and perhaps eventually uncovering a latent aesthetic within it that is at odds with their sense of quality

Non-conservatives don’t have this courage either. The difference is, they tend to have nothing to lose, and nothing to fear from understanding the new on its own terms. So they don’t need courage to do so.

Nothing inherently natural about tradition (that’s why there is such a variety) but there IS a link to validated modes of survival. 

Mimesis is an easy mode of calibrating a sense of quality but it is by no means the only way or the best way. Tinkering is a better way IMO. https://twitter.com/okohonen/status/1350552856819077120

I used to have a conservative streak when younger, in this aesthetics-first sense, but I never did cultivate a detail-oriented sensitivity to any kind of sensory experience. And if you get lazier as you get older, you realize tighter aesthetic standards = more maintenance chores.

Like say at 20, you and I both like chocolate chip cookies but have only ever had cheap Chips Ahoy commodity cookies. Over 20 years we both sample all kinds, from the finest gourmet ones, to various Grandma recipes etc. How might our cookie sensibilities have diverged by 40?

You, the aesthetics-first person, will likely have developed a deep distaste for Chips Ahoy grade “bad” cookies. You have your fine recipes, and favorite gourmet brand.

Me, despite being exposed to better cookies and developed some discernment, am still fine eating Chips Ahoy.

There’s learning to tell things apart, and learning to *care* about the differences. The non-aesthetics-first person can learn to tell and even perhaps appreciate differences to a degree. But they stop short of learning to care. Cookies are not aesthetics-first for philistines.

If you cannot learn distinctions without *necessarily* going on to care about differences, you’ll tend conservative, and start to censor out novelty where caring might be painful. Be causing learning to care is developing a pain sensitivity in order to live more exquisitely.

I suspect our notional cookie aesthete will experience near-physical pain if forced to eat an ordinary cookie. The non-aesthete might prefer a good cookie, but will not find it painful to eat an ordinary one.

I’m literally this way about cookies while my wife is a cookie conservative. She’ll experiment and fuss and go through agonies about them not coming out right. I’ll happily eat pretty much all her experiment outputs, whether failures or successes. I’m a Cookie Monster.

Right now, I’m working my way through a batch of Ted Lasso cookies, which she attempted to replicate after we both thought they looked good on the show. I think they came out great. She’s not happy with them and is now making a more reliable one she knows she likes.

Cookies for me are not primarily about optimally embodying the essence of cookie aesthetics. They are primarily a functional sugar hit to go with coffee. Anything above a fairly low satisficing baseline will do. I can never be a cookie conservative.

The tldr of this thread so far is that I eat garbage cookies and do not live exquisitely. This is not where I expected this thread to land.

This is the future true liberals want

This is my garbage cookie manifesto.

The universe is like chips ahoy cookies. Kinda dry and with an industrial terroir, but available everywhere, reliably mediocre, and consistently past the bare-minimum viable cookie threshold. When we colonize exoplanets, we will make such cookies across the galaxy.

## 65. Derelict Personhood

*January 31, 2021*

Imagine a homeless person who's clearly not all there, sitting muttering on the sidewalk in the middle of what looks like a loose pile of trash and possessions -- soiled clothes and rags, half-empty fast food and snack wrappers. All strewn about by a toppled shopping cart.
...

What adjectives and nouns, literal, metaphoric, or allegorical, would you use to describe this scene? If it were a photograph, what would you caption it?

(I've been seeing such scenes increasingly frequently in my neighborhood, and more generally over the last decade, everywhere I've lived... at one point, I thought I'd found the perfect verbal description, but then I forgot it and have never found it again)

The essence of such... tableaux?.... is that not only is it a homeless person at the center, but there is "nobody home". The sight lacks the coherence that functional minds tend to impose on their immediate surroundings. Consciousness as an ordering force is in retreat.

Such scenes were very rare for me growing up in India. Even though there was a lot of visible poverty and blight, and people living in poverty on sidewalks, they were "all there" in a sense, imposing some order on their little patch of sidewalk. That's the exception in the US.

Somebody who is in a state of high-functioning homeless poverty (to the extent you can be mentally healthy at all in such a state) tends to have a personal space boundary defined by a strong trash/not-trash filter for what level they have.

I'm not trying to make a moral point here, though obviously I have views on such matters. I'm kinda groping verbally around the sensory subject to find words for the phenomenology here. It's literally hard to describe such a scene with words.

You end up using too many words, and none are quite right. It's like being unable to stare directly at the sun or the void, where "stare" = apprehend with words. The verbal mind kinda slides off the scene, and you're left with just the sensory imprint of a consciousness corpse.

James Carse had a great bit in Finite and Infinite Games talking about how there's no trash in nature. It takes the ordering effects of the civilized, self-possessed mind to create a trash/not-trash boundary in the environment. And human bodies can cross that boundary.

Once as a teen, I saw such a person (un-person?) sitting in the middle of a busy street with honking traffic going around him, drivers yelling at him. I thought he'd fallen, so I dodged traffic to go into the street to try and help him up. He screamed at me and refused to get up.

That 1-minute incident made a pretty powerful impression on me and has stayed with me since. I can now tell when somebody is merely in a bad condition, versus kinda not there at all, having dissociated out of the situation entirely, letting their personal space unravel.

It was also a very powerful early lesson (I think I was 14 maybe) in the limits on one person being able to help another person, who's been mentally destroyed to the extent of not being a person at all in any normal sense. They are beyond help because they don't exist in a way.

I used to be a bit of a bleeding heart liberal kid before that incident, but I think that turned me very cautious about trying to help people. That sense that you can only help someone when they are "there" to be helped... you see it in weaker forms in less extreme situations.

A bit of shorthand/heuristic for this is via Maslow's pyramid. In order for one person to help another at level n, the latter must *exist* at level n+1.

You can't help with physiological needs if they're not "there" at safety. You can't help with safety if they're not there at "belonging". You can't help at "belonging" if they're not "there" at esteem. You cannot help with esteem if they're not "there" at self-actualization.

And you cannot help anyone with self-actualization at all, except by accident, because there isn't a higher locus to "stand" at to pull them up. Integrity of the self is a bootstrapped thing. You can only help up to the level the person has already bootstrapped enough to exist.

I should qualify this with -- *I* am limited in my ability to help others in this progressively constrained way. Others with more natural talent at helping may be able to help others who seem too far gone to me. I don't know.

To bring this around to those of us living in the conceit of imagining we're "all there" ... to somebody who's bootstrapped to a level beyond what you have, you will appear "homeless" and "nobody at home" and beyond help.

Incidentally, this isn't limited to humans. You can see animals on this spectrum too, from integrated self that is present at the maximum level that bodily design allows (insects, lizards, cats all have different scopes of self) to various stages of unravelled being.

An animal that has fallen apart within its  envelope of self is a piteous sight in exactly the same way. Even if it's only a bug that will instinctively eat its own severed leg.

I sometimes wonder... to advanced hyperdimensional aliens, looking down at me, would I appear to be homeless-and-not-at-home, sitting around in a pile of trash-and-not-trash on an 11-dimensional sidewalk? 🤔

"Consciousness-raising" (pilling in modern parlance) is the most cruel myth humans believe in. There's no such thing. There's only false consciousness raising.

Anyhoo... my caption for the word-portrait/photo would be "Re-enchant this!"

Wonder if there is a way to measure this. To me, it's the strongest sign of American collapse -- people who have crumpled and failed to maintain the integrity of the boundary of self we expect in their life station. People who are homeless-and-not-at-home at any level.

Most societies expect all members to be "at home" at the belonging level of Maslow to count as human (esteem level requires in-app purchases). Anybody who falls below is problem to be solved. Anyone who is not being actively "solved" has been abandoned and left behind.

The US is fairly unique in setting very high standards for acceptable "belonging" (at one point it was "home ownership") AND accepting a high rate of abandonment for those who fall. Poor countries tend to lower the threshold. Rich countries tend to lower the abandonment rate.

## 66. Cancel Culture vs Know-Your-Place Culture

*February 12, 2021*

In practice, the real alternative to cancel culture is usually know-your-place culture for the masses. Civil-debate-culture is not an actual option. It’s what elites get to enjoy when the masses know their place and stay there quietly without getting uppity.

There’s a weird linguistic thing here. English is a highly egalitarian language that represses know-your-place dynamics even though 2 big Anglo societies are not very egalitarian. Hindi has like a dozen ways to say “know your place” with varying degrees of violence.

In old Hindi movies there is often a rich patriarch antagonist telling a young person or woman to “know their place.” Often followed by a humiliating slap if the person (usually a sympathetic character) persists, with bystanders not daring to intervene. Redemption drama follows.

Note that both are violent forms of policing. What critics of cancel culture often seem to miss is that cultural policing abhors a vacuum. While there is scarcity and inequality somebody will be culturally policing somebody.

And of course it’s no accident that people who support cancel culture also want to defund policing that is de facto based on know-your-place culture.

Guilt culture/shame culture angle too. Anglo culture tends to be guilt based. Cancel tactics (and place-policing) are from shame-based cultures. That exacerbates things.

Place policing vs tone policing 🤔

If there is no social mobility one or both will get weaponized until something moves

Place policing is social mobility policing and often reduces to literal physical movement policing.

Funny thing about those Hindi-movie dialogues about knowing your place. Often they translate to something like "how dare you come HERE and speak in that arrogant manner! Don't you know your place?" Ie entirely ignoring the content and responding to the location.

Often, notions of "place" in society map to physical locations (public square, rich man's living room, pub, temple, etc) and a tone policing problem can be replaced with a place policing problem. Where elites have no problem with what you say, only where you say it.

A fascinating solution that Anglo societies have converged on is to simply eliminate public spaces. The more all spaces become private, the fewer locations there are where those who "don't know their place" can speak without consequences.

Note the close link between place and cancelation. "Deplatforming" refers to specific place access, and the private/public ownership of the platform matters, in a broader sense than the first amendment aspect of place.

This is not well understood in the US because it's in the past, and remnants are not obvious, but the public around the world was historically NOT a place anyone could speak. It was very specifically an elite "platform" defined by who was NOT allowed to speak there.

Which meant that "know your place" often meant "you can't say such things in public because it offends elites who have first right to such places; you can only say it skulking and muttering in ghetto alleys, and we'd better not hear you by accident!"

Observation: I rarely hear loud complaints about cancel culture except from people who are already talking a lot. Makes me wonder -- who isn't talking to begin with because they unfortunately "know their place" all too well. Who are born canceled and stay that way?

Personal angle btw... I've never felt either place or tone policed in my life. I have almost never wanted to say something and been unable to say it, or had to leave a place because I spoke out of place. And I obviously talk a lot and at great length in every place I can access.

Either I "know my place" very well and have internalized my boundaries to the point I don't notice myself staying within them...

OR I have better ways to fight when I want to than words...

OR... I don't have much to fight about, and am too selfish to fight for anyone else...

Like most people, it's probably some mix of all 3, alloyed with a healthy dose of just pragmatism of the don't-make-jokes-at-a-funeral variety... reasonable consideration for others.

In case it isn't obvious, I'm agnostic on this whole matter -- having opinions about the morality of tone policing or place policing is like having opinions about the existence of weapons. 

Weapons exist. Conflict is real. Get good at using the appropriate ones when needed.

I'm also agnostic about US gun culture tbh. I think it's really regressive and dumb in a religious way, and have no interest in getting literate in the use of guns, but don't have strong feelings about wanting it gone so long as I can stay safe myself. I can live with it.

American English does have a bit of the explicit sort of place-policing idiom to it, like "you come into MY house and... blah blah blah" but it's a fairly weaksauce version, usable in fewer places. In America it's almost more polite to just shoot people instead of grandstanding.

Interesting sidebar is on spaces that used to be private but are now subject to public dynamics via screenshot wars etc. For whatever reason, I've always operated in private as though whatever I say could potentially be made public in the future. Since long before culture war.

This is quite likely a personality preference on my part. Very INTP -- do all your actual thinking in your head, anything you actually say, regardless of context, is something of a performance (what we Myers-Briggs nerds call the Ti-Ne mode).

ie I might have a very different take if I had a different personality, of the sort that thinks best out loud, and in some cases out loud and in conflict mode (ESFJs?). In a way, being sanguine about this shit is a "free strategic option" for me. It costs me nothing to be immune.

Good question. I think the issue being contested is that the group privileged in public spaces has changed. Now the public is *most* accessible to those to whom it was *least* accessible in the past. The access hierarchy isn't gone. It's flipped polarity.  https://twitter.com/andrwwang/status/1360058522315161600

ie, to use the cartoon example, we are heading towards the point where a black lesbian can basically say anything in public, and a cis-white-male can only speak if spoken to. We are VERY far from that actual condition, but obv. the directional trend upsets those currently on top

This may be another reason I'm personally unable to develop strong feelings about the shift... "brown male" is sort of somewhere in the illegible middle of the totem pole whatever happens. The middle is actually the best place... no fighting needed to tread water there

A common objection I get when I offer this kind of class-based analysis is that all this is really elite-on-elite conflict (right now, for eg. rich liberal arts educated kids without jobs who got radicalized and grifterized by the GFC and neethood). This is not that important.

This goes back to at least Pareto's circulation of elites theory (lion elites vs. fox elites) who in turn drew from Machiavelli. The fact that currently-out-of-power elites are an intermediary in the elites-vs-masses conflict doesn't change the fact that it IS elites vs. masses.

Eg: Trump is obviously lion elite -- born to wealth, strongman ethos. He became the voice of one kind of non-elite. The NYT is fox elites... often rich trustie kids... who speak for another kind of non-elite. This is just plumbing you can nerd-out over, but rarely important.

So long as circulation of elites creates liquidity in the market for actual class warfare, the class warfare aspect is by far more important. Neither Trumpism, nor BLM, both of which try to place/ tone police each other's elites, is a pure elite-vs-elite conflict. Masses matter.

In fact, arguably, "circulation of elites" is itself *caused* by non-elites practicing a sort of emergent divide-and-conquer collective action tactic. I strongly suspect non-elites have no fixed loyalties to either lion types or fox types -- they get behind whoever is convenient.

Don't want to explain circulation of elites theory... look it up if you like. It's non-trivial, but not too complex to grok. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulation_of_elite

Freedoms often have initial conditions dependency that obscures costs. For eg rules for civil debate about religion that emerge when it’s Christians debating Christians in a 100% Christian society may seem cost-free... until you try to include non-Christians for the first time.

A lot of culture war stuff is people being in denial about the scope of a familiar freedom having expanded in a way that makes previously free things have a nonzero social cost. Usually because more people can be in more places. People hate paying for stuff that used to be free.

One now-old SJW line I’ve never heard a satisfactory counter to is “when you’re used to privilege, equality feels like oppression.”

This is a special case of a free thing becoming not-free because new people have entered a space. There are now consequences.

It’s still free as in speech. Just not as in beer. 

A lot of complaints about the first are actually complaints about the second. Cancelation is an extreme case, but is only different in degree, not kind, from just being called on stuff by people you’re not used to hear speak up

But some shit, I genuinely wonder if people feel muzzled or just newly ashamed. 

Let’s say you came of age in all-male misogynistic milieus (as I did) and were used to participating at least passively in no-cost (free as in beer) misogynistic humor. “Locker-room talk.” 
...

Back before PC demanded it, guys *automatically* self-censored misogynistic humor a bit when women were present. Even in Mad Men era.

Why did we do that before there were cancelation-type risks? Trads explain it as “respect for women” but that’s obvious bs.

Consequences.

The diff between then and now, is the diff between noblesse oblige type graciousness exhibited by the powerful to spare feelings, with mild consequences imposed by your own kind (“hey watch it bro, there are women present”) vs fear of consequences imposed by the actual targets.

People who get into a moral panic about cancelation should ask if they would ever *self-censor* because of who’s present. If there were no consequences at all today, in 2021, for making a racist joke, would you make it in every context? No context? Some contexts?

I suspect the cases that seem like egregious thought and speech policing of context-reasonable things obscure this more basic, uncontroversial progress in decency. 

All the actually tough cases involve authoritarian power grabs over institutions.

Yes, there have been egregious cases. Usually in the peripheries of institutional control battles. They should be analyzed for what they are — specific battles over institutional power. Like board seats or committee control. Speech policing/cancelation are red herrings there.

I mean, really... are you going to read ritual theater around occupying native lands in SF city meetings as an actual cogent discourse on native rights? Or is it better to treat that the way we treat (for eg) Carl Icahn commenting on business models  of companies he’s raiding?

Just as you don’t treat activist shareholder and PE raiding propaganda as meaningful business commentary, you shouldn’t treat institutional power struggles as meaningful cultural commentary.

And finally, le sigh the motte and bailey move of turning conversations about actual social justice into conversations about trusties writing for old media from Brooklyn. That’s the easy way out. Just because the messengers are easy to shoot, doesn’t mean the message is empty.

I’ve been basically stationary in the culture war since I started tracking it in 2013, because afaict nothing material has changed. Players have come and gone, careers have been made and unmade, and entire subcultures have swung around like starling murmurations.

It’s disappointing that people have basically lost all interest in all underlying real issues. The internet of beefs has fully taken over. But that doesn’t mean the substance of old issues has magically disappeared. It just means they are evolving in ungoverned, dark ways.

We’re now at peak-antiwoke, and the early beginning of the antiantiwoke phase of the culture war. Chapter 7 by my count. Is antiantiwoke the same as woke?  Stay tuned, we’ll find out in Chapter 8, the Rise of Threadthulhu, premiering in 2022.

Based on this poll, I hereby claim actual contrarian status. This thread won’t be popular with the majority of people who follow me (option 3 likely splits in ways that will be hostile to this thread) 🤣 https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1360036222924517376

Seeing some of the noise in responses since last night... shoulda made my definition explicit up front. 

Cancel culture is when people whose power rests relatively directly on public approval lose that power (and benefits thereof) via that approval turning to disapproval.

So a celebrity actor losing a role due to crowd pressure, and being cut out of future consideration for most roles is a fairly clear pure case. A big investor getting disinvited from a speaking gig, but whose money is untouched, is not being canceled, just disliked by some.

In general you have to be fairly rich and/or powerful on a public scale to be meaningfully cancel-able. It’s cancelation as in TV show, not as in dinner. And there has to be an actual mob (usually led by rival elites) demanding mob justice, but no grounds for actual legal action.

A mob demanding an arrest for suspected actual crime is not cancel culture.

Cases like a waiter getting fired due to being photographed at a neo-nazi rally are corner cases. They are being made an example of as representative of a minority  *group* with power by a larger group.

But don’t get too hung up on definitions. This is a fairly robust concept that is not sensitive to such details. Think “large, less powerful group policing small, more powerful group in extra-legal ways resulting in material losses exacted via social influence mechanisms”

Should also explicitly clarify on the "culture" point. We are expected to have a meta-level approval or disapproval of cancel *culture* rather than individual cancelations because there's a mechanism-legitimacy debate. Weird, but expected. https://twitter.com/s_r_constantin/status/1360192630290808836?s=20

The meta-level discussion is equivalent to questions like "is democracy better than monarchy?" We are not talking about good vs. bad mobs or good vs. bad emperors. We're talking about systematically legitimizing or delegitimizing a mechanism with both good/bad to it.

Opponents of "cancel culture" want to delegitimize the mechanism itself. The monarchism was once delegitimized regardless of goodness/badness of emperor, and some want to delegitimize capital punishment today regardless of severity of crime or theory of punishment and deterrance.

Setting aside the practical question of how you would actually do it technically and enforce it legally (would need a digital version of prohibition of large gatherings...), if you *could* literally turn off cancel culture, would you? You're expected to answer yes/no to that.

I don't think it's either technically or legally feasible without suspending democracy itself, so in a way people who think cancel culture is cancerous (40% in my poll above) should be read as thinking democracy itself is cancerous, though I doubt most have thought that through.

This matches general level of anti-democratic sentiment rn. I'd guess about a third of the people who voted "cancerous" will, if they stop to think, go on to support something like benevolent dictatorship or neo-monarchism or Chinese way as an alt. Other 2/3 will pull back.

## 67. Stakes vs. Costs

*March 10, 2021*

Feels like Sayre’s law increasingly applies to the world at large.

“Academic politics is the most vicious and bitter form of politics, because the stakes are so low” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre%27s_law

The stakes have never been lower. People get confused because they see high *costs* everywhere (climate action etc). Stakes are not costs. Stakes are why you care. Costs are what you pay.

Stakes: historically — children, afterlife fate of soul,  moral victory over communism.

Rick Sanchez pays very high costs for seemingly very low stakes (Mulan McNugget Szechwan sauce). Extreme form of Sayre’s law. He’s willing to destroy universes for it. When there are no natural high stakes to fight for, the intensity of the fighting sets the stakes.

Fukuyama Last Man psychology, trading NFTs etc.

It’s not “how can you waste resources on NFTs while climate change blah blah”

It is “how do you make reality worth caring about enough to pay the cost of something like climate action to save it?”

Interestingly, pain (your own or others’) is not in the stakes column. It’s in the costs column. Trying to see/create a world worth caring about by eliminating pain is an incoherent idea. This leads to a lot of philosophical frustration.

Problems are not stakes. This is one reason why tech critics who sermonizing about solving “real problems” completely fail to understand the logic of tech. Tech is about raising the stakes enough to make the hard problems worth solving.

Believe it or not, the value of something like Twitter is that it raises the stakes, making saving the works from climate disaster a bit more worth it. It does this via a cousin of the having-children kind of stakes. It is mutual involvement stakes.

The purest example of stakes is storytelling. Stories solve zero problems. Their only function is to pass the time while you decide whether life is worth living.

Nobody:

Absolutely nobody:

Storyteller: “Once upon a time...”

Crypto is a pure stakes technology

So are Mars rovers

So are all games

Anything that makes creates time out of information. As in, you want to hang around to see how something turns out.

Survival for its own sake is insufficient for humans.

Stakes = costs logic
———

“We must solve climate”

“Why?”

“How dare you!”

Stakes ≠ costs logic
———

“We must solve climate”

“Why?”

“So my great-grandkid can travel to Pluto/watch the 342nd MCU movie/figure out if P=NP”

So if you want to help it the vicious and toxic noise... do stuff that helps raise the stakes. Let the costs-obsessed people stay stuck in their stakes = costs flatland. Plenty of people will stop vicious fighting and line up to “solve hard problems” if the stakes are high enough

I don’t think kids are a solution tbf. They are as much of a metaphysical punt as belief in an afterlife. They don’t actually work  very well as stakes. They only supply acute meaning when they’re in danger. Normal times, parents seem no more fulfilled. Possibly less. https://twitter.com/ykgoon/status/1369528062304419840

But there’s something there. The minimum viable stakes seem to have indefinite reproductive potential. Stakes tend to be Turing-complete things like kids, robots, and other gene-meme things that might live forever in some sense.

Things that work as stakes have a fractal ability to conjure eternity in their universal potentiality. “To hold infinity in the palm of your hand, eternity in an hour” sorts thing. Turing-complete grains of sand.

Things through which we can live forever. Not eternalism per se but a sense of “some part of me will be around to see how the movie ends when the last proton decays”

A mundane thought I’ve had lately is this: while playing around learning electronics and 3d printing lately, I find I’m more willing to go down debugging trees and yak-shaves with *highly uncertain cost* when it seems salient to my larger project of building a rover.

Debugs and yakshaves break cost=stakes logic because you can incur arbitrarily large costs for arbitrarily trivial things. Breaks means-end reasoning, utilitarian cost-benefit bullshit, optimizing mindsets etc.

Bugs are Mulan McNugget sauce. You simply have to want them fixed.

If you want the irreducible thing itself, be it a Mars rover, a mansion, or mulan mcnugget sauce, it is effectively priceless. But something priced in pain is not worth more pain to remove. You wouldn’t endure worse pain than cancer to cure cancer. At least I wouldn’t.

And anything that you’re convinced is logically irreducible necessary, with no substitutes, to get to a priceless valued-for-itself thing is also priceless. The bug in the warp drive circuit is as priceless to resolve as warp drive is to have.

By contrast, anything that’s *not* necessary and has obvious substitutes is worth only as much debugging effort as would make the total cost less than the next-best  substitute solution. It’s a commodity. Marginal stakes contribution = cost of last option you could explore.

Circling back to topic: low stakes = high strife. There’s literally nothing anyone seems to want on the other side of (say) decarbonizing that inspires the sacrifices being demanded of all. It’s cliche but “Mars settlement” actually is the best idea around and only inspires ~20%.

Let’s be clear that pain avoidance, no matter how huge, is still finite and therefore a cost, not stakes. It’s the price-to-minimize of life, not the value of living.

Let’s say worst-case climate models are correct and we’re looking at 5 gens of extreme pain for say 100b human+animal souls. Add it all up with adequate kinship-discounting. 

It still won’t be stakes. Just costs. Why is life worth it for any of the 100b souls in the formula?

This imponderable is why stakes=costs people studiously avoid and taboo discussion of euthanasia and antinatalism. If a trivial solution exists to solve pain (don’t make babies, commit suicide painlessly) it subverts most of their logic. So ban all talk of that solution.

I like to keep that option in the picture as a null hypothesis. If you can’t imagine a future with more worthwhile stakes than the cost of the trivial pain-elimination solution, you’re not really trying.

The thing about priceless stakes is that they can actually be pretty transient. So long as they do the fractal-eternity thing, there’s always a next grain of sand to see the world in. If McNugget sauce keeps you interested today and next week it’s Mars rovers, that’s fine.

The key is to bootstrap a receding horizon into infinite time one way or another. In a way stakes is curiosity about how something in motion today will turn out past a horizon of prediction/planning. You can’t see it so your only option is to live to see it.

You either die a hero or live long enough to watch the sequel. 

Choosing life is always a kinda villainous option. The truly good are always acting dead. Goodness is stakes blindness. All is pain because that’s all you can feel.

A lot of this thread is what people usually discuss under the heading of Meaning Crisis,™ which I increasingly dislike. “Meaning” imo is an unhelpful concept. “Stakes” is better. The thing against which the cost-of-living is evaluated as either worth it or not.

The physical metaphor of a stake — a spike driven into the ground to claim a part of the universe besides yourself is great. A declaration of a non-minimal life. Its meaning or lack thereof can be set aside. It’s your point of positive involvement with reality.

I think “meaning” frames are popular because they’re backwards compatible with religion. They tend to inspire religion-like efforts to conjure new stakes to replace subverted ones. “Nostalgia for the Absolute” as George Steiner called it. It’s a bad design pattern.

Of the many religion knock-offs, modern fiat money is probably the best. Most of the features of religion with only some of the awful bugs. Plus it solves some problems and alleviates some pain too. More so than religion ever did.

That’s the bar for shared stakes. The thing to beat in the stakes-raising/meaning olympics.

Personal aside: I recently realized that a lot of my time that I privately code as downtime/shitposting time is really stakes-raising time. Many activities, such as tv and Twitter serve to raise stakes for me. Pump it back up when it runs low. Stakes are a flow not a stock.

I need a higher fraction of my duty cycle devoted to stakes-raising because I’m meh on most of the usual ones that seem to work for most people.

It’s like being battery powered and charged by solar panels vs being on the grid.

This is possibly why my new spirit animal is a Mars rover. Thing gets about 6h activity on good charging days whether solar or RTG)

## 68. Self-Disruption

*April 28, 2021*

To disrupt, you have to serve a marginal customer
To be product-driven, you have to serve your own vision

So to self-disrupt, you have to serve a currently marginal part of your own vision

Which means a toy/game/hobby feature

For an individual it literally means hobbies

Hmm. A “tell” is apparently wasteful use of dev time while more “important” product features (lifestyle features for individuals) demand attention. Logic of ideas like “waste transistors” rests as much on “marginal” features (GUI etc) as cheap raw materials.

Diagnostic questions:

1. What can you waste?
2. What’s a seemingly useless thing you could waste it on?
3. Who will be mad about it?

If nobody is mad, there is no disruption. For product-driven, the “responsible” side of you has to get mad. Id make superego mad. Ego must choose

It’s always bothered me that disruption theory assumes a customer-driven mindset, but the most disruptive companies tend to be product-driven. They find marginal markets by orienting towards peripheral visions, rather than directly asking “what marginal market can I serve?”

In the geometric metaphor, a market is a circle and has one center (incumbent) but infinite margin points. Not all will do. For disruption it has to coincide with a bit of your own peripheral vision. The future you see out the corner of your eye rather than straight ahead.

Though the undetermination problem exists there too. There are probably many silly features in your peripheral vision. Which one to make the new center? Probably the one it’s easiest to waste time and attention on. For individuals, which of your many evening/weekend hobbies?

I have at least half a dozen right now personally.

Some are clearly NOT my next thing despite being current hobbies (eg hiking, cooking with new air fryer, new tv shows I’m getting into)

Time spent is a decent but not perfect proxy. A better proxy might be “troubleshooting time” — how much time you spend fixing things when stuck

If it looks too rainy or hot, I’ll cancel a hike or run, so I’m obviously not super committed there. Problems with my 3D printer I’m more likely to try and troubleshoot rather than give up. 

Even troubleshoot is too broad. It’s narrower: intersection of troubleshoot/workaround.

What can *stop* you from the next step? I probably give up on some 3D printing problems (PETG might be too temperamental for me) but where it stops my next step on rover project I’ll either fix it or find a non-3D printing workaround.

In some cases, the activity is the hobby for its own sake. In other cases, it’s a means to an end that’s the real hobby. My current tinkering is a mix of both. The 3D printing is mostly means to an end. The electronics dabbling is more of an end in itself.

Hmm... something interesting about troubleshooting as the essence. When you’re going a new thing, the scope creep from that is unpredictable. It could remain sustainable at a couple of hours a week, or take over your life if you decide you’re not going to let setbacks stop you.

Like take the rover I’m trying to build. For a more skilled maker, who has already done a lot of 3D printing, electronics, RPi coding etc, this is a well-defined, well-scoped, *contained* project. It can stay hobby grade. They’ll avoid most dumb bugs, troubleshoot things quickly.

It can’t be life changing for them because it’s not a true growth experience. 

For me otoh, new to all of it, it could easily consume my life because I am making way more dumb mistakes, taking far too long to troubleshoot trivial setbacks, etc. Open scope.

Disruption means you’re leaning a new activity and allowing yourself to be transformed by it. The “fixing one bug creates two more” effect dominates. You have to let the scope creep proceed as much as it needs to. If you try to budget time/resources too much, it will fail.

The real risk is, you’ll run out of growth headroom before you get anywhere sustainable. For every successful disruptor there are a hundred carcasses of overreach.

Possibly the only thing you can do to derisk is ask if you can handle the transformation overall. Which means accurately understanding the strengths that allowed past transformations to succeed, not “peacetime” skills between self-disruptions.

This is the what’s toughest in my current attempted self-disruption. For eg. writing is a “peacetime skill” for me that I find a way to use in every new adventure. But it’s not a relevant strength for self-disruption. I’m trying to remember what sustained my last big leap.

Often it’s a window of opportunity to grow with a young medium. Looking back, my last half dozen self-disruptions over 20 years all piggybacked on a newish medium for the context. Early adoption is possibly the secret weapon for self-disruption. It ties in to what you can waste.

Damn. I’ve figured it all out. Don’t feel like fleshing it out in a post though.

Self-disruption is next door to play but IMO isn’t truly playful. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1387513076702793731

In the short-term, early on, it’s like play, but beyond a point it gets too big and dangerous. Capped vs uncapped stakes. Safe fail vs unsafe bets.

## 69. Return on Risk

*April 30, 2021*

What’s percent of your income is return on risk as opposed to compensation for effort?

I don’t mean in a tax sense of capital gains. I mean any part of your income that’s due to a risk you took with uncertain return that could have been 0.

I think mine has been ~15-30%.

Rents, passive income, capital gains are tax-legible subsets of the larger nebulous category of return on risk. 

The optimal is probably <30% otherwise you suffer curse of resources.

Hard to actually estimate. For eg carefully researched conservative investments are mostly return on effort even if treated as return in risk. You put in effort to lower the courage needed. The courage needed to take an irreversible action is the actual measure of risk.

Not really. It’s more that courage doesn’t actually teach you very much even though returns can be high. It’s good to be courageous, but to the extent it’s a substitute for thought, you give up learning and growth. https://twitter.com/JUSTINPUSHAS/status/1387986033334128643

Eg: meta-multiple choice test

a) Lazy and not cowardly: guess, score 25%
b) Industrious and cowardly: study, score 100%
c) Lazy and courageous: steal answers, score 100%
d) Industrious and courageous: phone in test you don’t care about, score 60%, do something better with time

d is a calculated risk: you could be wrong about “something better” and subject was worth learning more than whatever you blew it off for

c is curse of resources effect of risk-taking courage if subject was worthwhile. You just robbed future self of knowledge by being courageous

I’ve probably taken more risks than optimal and suffered curse of resources to some extent... to a degree I’ve taken the “easy A’s” path through life because I’ve been decent at spotting good risks to take. Might have been better for me to have been forced down harder paths.

I’m not particularly courageous but I’ve been good at spotting high return-on-courage options that fit me personally very well that few others could have made use of. Options that didn’t call for much courage from me but would have for many people who aren’t me.

The costs are now becoming apparent. I wish I had more hard-earned skills now than I do. Skills that would be very fulfilling to have now. The downside of “work smarter, not harder” is that you lose the subtle positive externalities of working harder in terms of more growth.

Sometimes the point is to do the hard work. There’s no point being clever and figuring out a machine to log 10k steps on pedometer just to get insurance discount. You’re ultimately just fooling yourself.

Curse of resources from risk-taking = external compounding rewards at the expense of internal growth you actually need.

When you take a risk, account for lost internal growth too. Best if that stays constant while external payoff curve is reshaped.

Think of risk taking as opening yourself up to luck, like drilling for oil.

But if you actually strike oil... yeah you’re gonna turn into Saudi Arabia to some extent and wither away a big due to lost inner growth opp.

An idiosyncratic definition of intelligence is inspired by the idiom “too clever for your own good.”

Intelligence is the ability to spot unreasonably high return-on-courage bets for *you*

Encompasses self knowledge and world knowledge. Not IQ. YouQ? UQ?

Whatever my absolute intelligence relative to others by your favorite flawed measure, I’m probably too clever for my own good because I have been able to engineer life to be easier than was good for me. Now at 46 I don’t know how to work hard enough at hard earned skills 🤣

It feels like a weird thing to say, but my primary life challenge now is learning to work harder and more patiently than I know how to, and strictly avoid the temptations of being clever.

Oddly enough, the key to taking on this project has been maximizing “leisure.” Only in true leisure, in pursuit of uneconomic goals with no real external payoffs to game for, are you truly free to work as hard as necessary without fooling yourself. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1387981172827836420

If there’s an external goal I can get to that’s “worth” more than the internal growth of getting it the right way, I am usually clever enough to achieve it with much lower effort. So removing the external goal value entirely forces me towards the internal. So borderline art.

Make it worthless or even negative worth to be “too clever for your own good.”

If you believe in IQ you want the highest IQ compatible you can have without having attendant mental health issues elsewhere.

But YouQ should ideally be 100. Exactly smart enough for your own good. Not more or less.

This is why I really like space exploration. Nobody has ever come up with a non-bullshit objective external reason to do it. The only reason to do it is internal. You can’t be too clever for your own good in space exploration because it’s worth nothing externally.

I suspect this line of thought leads many smart people to religion if they add one fatalist leap of faith: that the universe has arranged the perfect set of life challenges for your maximal spiritual development and trying to be clever with risk taking is cosmic foolishness.

This I don’t buy. The universe is pretty random. The challenges life throws at you have no intrinsic meaning. Unfortunately you actually have to choose when to take the easy-courageous way around, and when to take the hard-submissive way through.

Many tragicomic paths begin with the hope that life is meaningful enough that surrendering agency and doubt is a metaphysically smart thing to do. Hence the focus on surrender and submission in all religions.

Not that it can’t lead to brilliantly wrong metaphysics. Leibniz was a risk-taking royal-ass-kissing, solipsistic hustler, but also seemed to be genuinely religious in exactly this sense. He believed the universe was fractally optimal at every instant down to the last monad.

Leibniz was possibly the ultimate “too clever for his own good” guy. So clever he invented calculus and computers and for an encore fooled himself into believing Spinoza was wrong with an intricately wonderful bullshit-vitalist metaphysics (monadology)

Probably a good bit of commencement speech type advice for kids would be: pick one useless thing you’re neither going to get clever with, nor let others dictate how you pursue, and design life around reserving your peak hours for that.

Get as clever as you like in adjacent things. Take risky shortcuts etc to pay the bills in other areas. But the one core thing. Keep it off limits for cleverness, external incentives, and surrendering of control.

“Center your purest hobby in your most free hours every day Luke”

I guess I accidentally approximately did that. Except writing would probably not have been the thing I’d have picked if I’d actually given this idea serious thought at say 22.

Purest = least susceptible to external incentives, most deeply entangled with who you are

Since a few people are asking what I'd have chosen at age 21 instead of writing if I'd consciously thought of it this way... I've been answering 'parkour'. It's partly a joke, but also partly hindsight wisdom. I'm way overindexed on life of mind over life of body, with high cost.

I'm not particularly athletic, but not particularly unathletic either, and there was a time when I could have, at relatively low but patient effort, set myself up for a far more healthy future. Now it would take 100x the effort and I'm like "just accept progressive decrepitude"

It's not as bad as that... I do work out and put some effort into staying in shape, but it's mostly damage mitigation and stop-loss levels. The decades of underinvestment can't be reversed.

And I did used to actually enjoy several physical activities enough, and was unterrible enough at them, that they were real options 20 years ago... ultimate frisbee, swimming, running, hiking. I just didn't choose to ever invest at more than casual level.

I have a feeling that would have been an investment that would have floated all boats (including mental) in middle age.

Just realized that what I mean here is roughly what Douglas Hofstandter means by a "strange loop" ... activities that are entangled enough with identity all the way down https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1388019291610509314

## 70. Straussian Taste Bureaucracies

*June 5, 2021*

Anything that needs a certificate of authenticity is a grift

I was mildly amused by the banana taped to a wall last year, but I’m no longer amused by that sort of stunt. This is the thing that sparked the thought. It’s a kind of cultural entropic dissolution. https://hypebeast.com/2021/6/salvatore-garau-lo-sono-invisible-sculpture-18k-usd-sale

I’m sure my art world friends have some sort of theory of how it’s a cutting insider satire about the whole art world being a money laundering con or whatever... but really? You can’t find a more interesting way to waste time and energy? This is a zombie’s idea of a joke.

It does take a certain ennervated blithe cleverness, though this one is particularly lazy. The quantum mumble-jumbo spiel that is the performance-PR-art component is not even interestingly silly physics. 

You got a media buzz cycle going Mr. Garau. Yay for you. Fries with that?

There was a good essay I read a few years ago about the slow rot of “MFA program fiction” ... about how writers got so good at playing to conventions of the institutionalized literary orthodoxy they got unreadable. Feels like the art world needs a dose of that kind of reflection.

This kind of nihilism is the mark of a sort of Straussian bureaucracy of taste and resources. When artists are more talented at getting grants than at making art, you get this sort of thing. Happens in any field where ground truths are either absent or reducible to solipsism.

Regular Straussianism is overly respectful attitudes towards “great men” (or more precisely, their high priests).

Bureaucratic Straussian is overly respectful attitudes towards the institutionalized tastes. The *best* outcome is mannerism. The worst is this sort of thing.

Ultimately the only person who can keep you honest is you. If you’re moderately smart, it’s just too easy to get literate in the taste culture around an institution or powerful individual. You can’t help figuring out how to push buttons to make bank. The challenge is not to.

It’s even harder to resist temptation when _not_ operating within a coercive taste culture with monopolistic ambitions attracts active hostility. If you happen to make it work without seeking (or worse, refusing) their approval, prepare for hell to rain down.

Hell hath no fury like a tastemaker scorned. And it’s insecurely attached ones at the margins who are the worst. The ones at the center/top tend to be cheerfully mercenary about being the masters of the grift and tend to be grudgingly respectful if you care enough to stay away.

I’m puzzled by this phenomenon. Seems like some taste cultures need to keep putting on reductio ad absurdum spectacles to self-calibrate. Whether it is this, or John Cage’s 4’43” or the real fashion show that inspired the Mugatu/Derelicte bit in Zoolander. https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/lvmh-the-civil-savage

I mean pop culture/low art doesn’t need to do this. McDonald’s doesn’t sell a nothingburger in the form of a paper bag with an empty wrapper. Hollywood doesn’t try to sell you tickets to a 2 hour blank-screen movie. So why does high-art need nihilistic absurdity to calibrate?

I suspect it has no larger logic beyond simply pre-empting and co-opting criticism and arrogating to itself the sole right to judge itself.

“You normies cannot possibly criticize us more subtly and cleverly than we criticize ourselves. Now give us taxpayer money or your ancient civilization dies.”

It feels like a gated community HOA trying to con neighboring non-HOA blocks into thinking their regulations apply more broadly than they do and trying to enforce a tax. And they kinda get away with it.

A slightly more sympathetic reading is that institutions are tangent to the arc of history at the point of their founding. As reality twists and turns away from the tangent they turn into degenerate lower-dimensional spaces signifying nothing.

The emptiness is actual barrenness. It is relatively lifeless the way the middle of the Sahara is relatively lifeless compared to the Amazonian rainforest. Yeah, there’s some lizards and stuff, but basically it’s a bunch of mostly sand.

Talent hits the target others can’t hit

Genius hits the target others can’t see

Taste bureaucracy certifies the target you’re allowed to pay to aim at as Officially Good Targets™ 

It’s an attempt to establish rents by monopolizing some enforceable definition of True Art™

Nice try at a non-bullshit rationale but I actually think it’s calibration of how much you can get away with as a measure of the hegemonic cultural power you have. The Emperor knows he is powerful when his courtiers pretend to believe in invisible new clothes. https://twitter.com/genmon/status/1401078724192346114

I like alt reading of the fable. Far from being a gullible fool, the emperor, like the child who calls him out, *knows* he has no clothes. He wants to see if either courtiers or public will dare call out his flagrant lie that he’s wearing invisible clothes.  Trumpy loyalty test.

ROFL this is perfect. Hans Christian Anderson backstory...

The MFA program fiction thing I mentioned earlier in the thread. This but for any such field. https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree

Note that critique has its own issues. It’s basically “MFAs should listen to literature PhDs.” It suggests that the ahistorical no-context “innocence” posture adopted by postwar pomo MFA writing should bend a knee to academic-literary history/theory. A cure as bad as the disease.

I think I’m a historicist-anarchist. Work in the context of a historical sensibility, but avoid being trapped by any *tradition* of history. 

Anarchic historical sensibility > historical institutional tradition > ahistorical institutional tradition

The “tradition” you situate your work in is simply the context created by everything you’ve chosen to consume, not things you were institutionally coerced to consume. Of course you can *choose* to borrow from traditions or entertain suggestions, but agency is yours.

Traditions make good servants but poor masters. They’re like librarians. A librarian might occasionally make a good suggestion on what to read, but their main job is to help you find things related to what *you’ve* decided to read.

If you let a tradition pwn you, producing vacuous works of satirical commentary with trollish “certificates of authenticity” is the least of your risks. The big risk is you’ll have no fun at all and wonder why the hell you’re going through motions larping artist or writer.

Institutionalized art is *safe* like 1980s IBM

Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM
Nobody ever got fired for writing MFA program fiction
Nobody ever got fired for making grant-art
Nobody ever got fired for writing Hugo/Nebula-intent sf

“Fired” in art = ostracized from a scene

The larger idea I’m criticizing is the unspoken claim than the only available contexts to situate anything you do are institutional traditions. That without the imprimatur of a tradition not only is your work suspect/poor/vanity (which is fine), but that it exists in a vacuum.

One reason I enjoy the wild internet as my context is that it’s actually richer than interior of any given tradition. If you don’t care about your access to traditions being officially sanctioned, you can access all the innards plus 10x stuff in the unincorporated interstices

Anarchic cultural production  principles

Deregulate institutionalized cultural production

Disregard cultural production sumptuary laws

Don’t pay cultural rents

Hold tastemakers accountable

Ignore gatekeepers 

Stop treating vacuity like meta-art

Publish online first

And use comic sans if you want

What if... institutional art is screensavers for money? 🤔

## 71. Riff on Kata-Style Learning

*June 5, 2021*

I once attended a talk about “coding kata.” I don’t think the idea ever took off. It works even worse with hardware. 

Something about engineering seems to defy learning through abstract formal exercises of growing combinatorial complexity. Like music scales or kata. Wonder why.

This may even be the dividing line between artisan craft and engineering. Unlike woodworking or other traditional proto-engineering crafts, the modern maker world is engineering, just at low-cost amateur level. It lacks the “katafibiality” of skills.

My suspicions: specialization of both labor and objects kills katafiability. Music has 12 semitones, martial arts have perhaps a dozen basic movements. My beginner Arduino electronics kit has like 50 components, all with idiosyncratic features to learn. My dremel has 28.

And this *beginner* level shit, barely scratches the surface. I’m now vaguely oriented in a world of 100s of electronics parts, and a seasoned electronics maker has a vocabulary of 1000s I think. Same with mechanical (think types of drill bits, fasteners…).

And these universes have very little formal structure. The theory of circuits structures this universe of artifacts far less than the mathematics of harmonic ratios structures music or geometry and kinematic structure martial arts.

It’s a bit like CISC over RISC (complex vs reduced instruction set computing, 2 architectural approaches in semiconductors). 

The thing is, the larger universe is not “spanned” in a simple way by the combinatorial space around a small set. At best you get 80-20.

As in 80% of the variety is composite constructs from 20%. For example the L298N is a chip that contains too full H-bridge circuits, which you could also wire up with hookup wires and individual transistors and diodes on a breadboard. It’s not a “note” but a “scale”

…BUT

… 20% of the parts (probably more?) are NOT like that. They introduce *new* physics into the game. New “notes.”

For eg. thermistor introduces the physics of resistance+temperature. When you first make a thermistor circuit you have to add a new primitive “note” to vocabulary.

Every new component or tool has like a 20% chance of pushing you into new physics. 

There’s that line “physics is the only science, everything else is stamp collecting.” Well, engineering is stamp collecting IN physics.

This is why, though most of my education is in formal foundations in math/physics, I think overindexing on that misses the point. It totally elides the part of engineering that is stamp collecting. You need the basic conceptual literacy to read/parse the stamps, but it’s stamps.

This is also why toys like this (I’ve been seeing this ad for weeks) leave me meh. If you’re struggling with concepts so much you need this, you’re in trouble. This removes what’s actually important about working with things. This is a math toy, not an engineering toy. https://twitter.com/UpperStoryCo/status/1399358682459115521

In engineering school, what this toy is apparently trying to teach is conveyed through (for eg) the differential equations for RLC circuits and spring-mass-damper systems being similar. It’s a math class, not a shop class. It’s basic literacy needed to do the stamp collecting.

I think many toys make this mistake. They try to teach basic theoretical concepts that you’ll eventually learn with math/physics classes. Cute but redundant. But you get an illusion of learning stamp-collecting side that you can’t learn in a math/physics course, when you’re not.

In a way all the maker stuff I’m playing with and posting about right now is an attempt to kinda set aside the math/physics foundations, and re-establish hands-on stuff on independent empirical/phenomenological “stamp collecting” foundations.

The math/physics is still important, but as a cost of doing business. It’s an entry-level boundary condition that separates engineering from vocational technician skills.

That divide btw is an interesting one. Somehow industrialization created a vocational layer mostly sealed off from engineering. Welders, machinists, electronics assembly people, plumbers,… a vast universe of technicians who can get away with very limited math/physics.

Industrial vocations are partly descended from artisan trades, partly, artificial constructs like video games. You may intuit physics of wood if you do woodworking, but there’s no chance a minimum wage circuit assembler can intuit semiconductor physics with no textbooks.

Yeah, good point. There is “infrastructure fluency” in a few key tools (like a soldering iron) but in general, fluency is neither a thing in engineering, nor particularly central. You *expect* work to feel awkward and non-fluent half the time. https://twitter.com/nbouscal/status/1401266380893261824

Another good point. Advanced math starts to feel like extremely discriminating stamp collecting. Once you get past foundations and basic skills, all the action is in the “rare stamp” theorems that are *both* true and important in the ocean of unimportant trivial truths. https://twitter.com/alexisgallagher/status/1401262491330514944

For example, early in linear algebra/control theory you learn about the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, an important “stamp.” A non-trivial AND important truth as in lots of important stuff depends on it. Like a breadboard or a drill in making. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley–Hamilton_theorem

One of the reasons I didn’t get far in math is that though I was good at the raw skills like manipulating trigonometric identities or differentiation or Laplace transform mechanics, I never developed a “taste” for how to wield the important and charismatic theorems/equations.

Things like the CHT or say the Brouwer fixed-point theorem are like temperamental tools with strong “personalities” (think soldering iron) that give you superpowers once you master them. I’m citing these because they are among the few I *did* gain some literacy in.

By contrast, I gave up on topology after the first grad course because it is just *full* of such things. Topology is the “fantastic beasts and where to find them” part of math. Really advanced stamp collecting. If I understand correctly, Grothendieck was a sort of Newt Scamander.

I’m possibly doing an injustice to music and martial arts here, but I think they’re closer to Euclidean geometry than engineering. As in, the combinatorial space covers most of it, and what isn’t covered is more subconsciously/tacitly learnable. https://twitter.com/epithetos/status/1401271301533319169

While there’s stuff beyond the combinatorial space of scales/ragas etc, it it’s mostly tacit. Things like instrument-specific timbre and elements like microtones (raga musicians in particular go on and on about that and entire schools rest on microtonal aesthetic theories)…

Fair enough… I imagine you might suddenly run into a particular weird “new physics” effect while experimenting with a particular combination of formal scale/instrument/microtonal flourishes. Often those are what I personally like best in music. New emergent effects. https://twitter.com/epithetos/status/1401273190656184321

I can believe it. I have a suspicion that kata is bullshit work. Practicing basic combinations/drill (kihon) and sparring (kumite) make sense, but kata never made sense to me. I gave up karate after a year in grade school because they only did kata and it bored me to tears. https://twitter.com/DanielleFong/status/1401273941239513089

Come to think of it, this may also be why I never pursued music. My tabla teacher had me doing kata-like drills for years and I never got to accompaniment performance (the equivalent of sparring) while some friends in more musical families were learning accompaniment from day 1.

Maybe conclusion from this thread is that kata/etude like things don’t just fail in engineering, but they don’t even really work where they are common by tradition. Probably overstating the case, but why not. Null hypothesis: all kata-like things are bullshit work. Any defenders?

I’m tempted to connect kata like things to pattern language type ideas and call bullshit on that too, since they’re clearly cousins. But I don’t want to be murdered by the Christopher Alexander mafia 😆

Friction is real action, flow is self-indulgence? 🤔 https://twitter.com/rhettford/status/1401271414368325632

The problem here is that there’s no real value to repeating the exercise. It’s a one-time thing, and doing it again or even on a new board doesn’t do much. The essence of kata is repetition. I don’t think anybody would do 100s or 1000s of led-blink or hello-world programs. https://twitter.com/rhettford/status/1401270955377184769

## 72. Scams Favor Vertical Integration

*June 11, 2021*

True or false?

Scams are more likely to be vertically integrated.

This feels true

Okay I’ve talked myself into believing this. The logic is simple. Vertical integration lends itself to more powerful branding and differentiation. This moves positioning from concrete commodity features to abstract woo and aura. Much friendlier to grift.

In Charles Fine’s Clockspeed there’s a model (dated;  book is from 90s) about how industries cycle through vertical/horizontal. You get vertical phases when knowledge is more complex than orgs and highly tacit. Sectoral pioneer phases and macro disruptions drive verticality.

You get horizontality when org structure catches up, tacit knowledge gets codified, stack layer interfaces of formerly vertical structure get opened up. Brands weaken, horizontal products/ services compete on features and industry benchmarks rather than differentiation aura.

There is of course grift in horizontal eras too. But the type is different and solution is different.

In a declining vertical era you get eroding brand promise. Brands go from standing for superior differentiated quality aura to overpromise/under-deliver and monopolistic apathy.

In a horizontal era, knockoffs and unbranded sketchy quality things compete with branded things. Price premium is commanded by relationship trust and QA guarantees.

Vertical eras are driven by distant marketing pull, horizontal by relationship sales push. 

Vertical marketing is built around customer belief in secret sauces, the horizontal sales is built around customer beliefs in quality guarantees.

We’re at the tail end of a 13-year vertical phase. Brands are eroding. Every major brand is being hollowed out. Claims of differentiation are increasingly bullshit and get called out as such. Cunning buyers develop market intelligence in cheaper grey market products and services.

Horizontal integration I strongly suspect is on the rise. Supply chain uncertainty is an accelerant for what was already ascendant.

Pick a horizontal slice. Aggregate demand, compete on quality/features, forget differentiation, mostly ignore brand marketing, focus on sales trust

Call it h-commerce.

I’m now open for h-commerce consulting. You’ll get ISO-certified, industry standard benchmark-leading advice on how to go horizontal, with 30% more features than other consultants offer at my price point. Call now for free samples.

Kidding aside, if I were to consult horizontally what would I consult on? And is consulting pro or countercyclic?

The two axes of consulting specialization are sectoral and functional. Functional tends to align with vertical eras, sectoral with horizontal. This margin doesn’t have enough room for the proof. 

I’m mostly functional and therefore a natural fit to vertical eras.

I’ll have to check but most of my clients have been vertical. Where I’ve worked with horizontal clients it’s been despite my own positioning not because. I myself am pretty vertically integrated.  There’s nobody upstream or downstream of me in the value chain besides platforms.

I do have some sectoral preferences and strengths, but it is shallow and accidental. If I went deep on a sector, my whole approach would have to shift. Dunno if I can. There’s other ways to go horizontal as a consultant but they are not as obvious. And harder to pull off.

When you see a sketchy vertical player, ask: what are you hiding under apparent differentiation?

When you see a sketchy horizontal player, ask: what are you hiding under apparent substitutability? https://twitter.com/keithmadams/status/1403494131725258754

## 73. Herzog-Veblen Principle

*June 14, 2021*

Herzog-Veblen principle: Wildernesses are murderous but lazy places. Savagery does not respect effort. Visible effort marks you as food. The harder you work the more you look like lunch.

Online=wilderness. 

Conspicuous hustling is not sustainable past a point online. Even if you can keep going, the lolcow optics will get you and you’ll be somebody’s lunch. 

You either chill out, or hide further hustling inside an organization.

The only place to safely work hard is in a cage.

My cat made me write this. He thinks I don’t work hard enough and tweeting more might get me more gigs. He’s a savage but not very bright.

>> The only place to safely work hard is in a cage.

Or at an obviously unnecessary task

## 74. The Rule of 5

*June 15, 2021*

There’s a theory that the ability to have painful conversations in large groups is some sort of valuable and advanced skill that we must practice. I submit that this skill is psychological science fiction. No group larger than 5 people has ever had such a conversation.

Above 5 people, any overture to start such a conversation, no matter how hard you try to be kind, will be an accusation of moral crimes leveled against an abstract archetype that will result in polarized derp based identifying with/against that archetype.

Try not to identify strongly with any archetype of n > 5, even if you can’t escape the consequences of such identification on the part of others. Try to base any response on an identification of the counter-party with a < 5 group. Small enough to name all members.

This thread prompted by yet another profoundly futile outrage cycle triggered by yet another attempt to spark such a conversation. I won’t link to it. But it’s not enough to starve such things of attention. You need alternative ways to talk about those things.

I propose a “Rule of 5” model.

Stop criticizing or holding accountable large abstract classes of people. And stop trying to make an “example” of members of the class, no matter how egregious. 

Instead pick on 5 named people, living or dead.

5 is large enough to establish a structural pattern worth acting on, and force you to build a somewhat general moral case, but not so small that you’re unfairly picking on one “example.”

The rule works for most kinds of passive  complicity in real but nebulous bad things.

Pick on individuals only when they are structurally special. Like Epstein or Trump, catalyzing a lot of bad from a uniquely privileged structural position. Not just “public figures.” 

Only when you can’t find 4 other examples in their close milieu.

I think even billionaires deserve the pattern-of-5 model. There’s enough of them that if you think 1 billionaire is doing a bad thing you should be able to find 4 more.

This is not to protect them, but to protect you from the temptations of careless and futile moral jousting.

A good example is the USC admissions scandal. They took down enough at once that the pattern was clear. Yes they probably took down the vulnerable ones and worse offenders likely got away, but it was a decently surgical strike. As good as it can get probably.

Buffet’s heuristic of “praise specifically, criticize generally” is basically wrong in 2021. It only works in narrow, homogeneous, contexts that don’t contain their own externalities. A kind of context that’s increasingly hard to sustain without doing sketchy kinds of gatekeeping

If your context has sufficient scope and heterogeneity, both praise and criticism should be small patterns by default. Hence Rule of 5.

Praise/criticize in named groups of 5 by default
Individually by exception
Archetypally never

If something good is happening, chances are more than one person is riding a systemic serendipity. Picking out 5 lets you praise individuals a bit but also flag the pattern, inviting others to ride it, and counter-programming the temptation to feed attribution bias.

It’s fine to traffic in archetypes or even stereotypes when you sense the conversation is not “difficult” and within the scope of good-natured jokes/roasting that will be received as such. This means enough mutual trust and small enough power differential.

Been thinking along these lines for a few years, but I was stuck on 1:1. That’s an ideal in some ways. When you engage 1:1 it’s hard to truly dehumanize. You’re forced to see the other person as a human and if not, have your inhumanity witnessed. But it doesn’t scale.

The rule of 5 scales, works at a distance, works on large orgs, etc. Forces due diligence, generates proof of systemic problems in the process of formulation etc.

If the rule in a court of law is “innocent until proven guilty” the rule in a court of public opinion is “guilty until proven innocent” and there’s no good middle ground. Rule of 5 is not as sloppy and type-1-error-prone as mob law, not as type-2-error-prone  as court law.

No point decrying mob law/court of public opinion. It’s a permanent feature of the species. No point trying to make courtroom law more expansive. Thar be abuses. But we can invent a third type.

Juries have guardrails unstructured conversations don’t, so they can scale a bit. https://twitter.com/phillippepayant/status/1404610310623830018

Just occurred to me that the NYT practices a perverse inversion of this trend, when there are ~3-5 named individuals on the provocation side as in “these 3-5 people claim iPad use causes racism.” A specious “difficult conversation” premise propped up by bearing anecdotal witness.

Another way to remember this heuristic: to a first approximation, the largest group that can do effective unstructured conflict resolution is a nuclear family. And it really sucks even at that scale. Above that you’re just picking a fight that will reproduce bad patterns.

For eg if a group A is trying to fight a group B for change in an institution, and A+B >5, then whatever the outcome, it will harden and further reify the most visible archetypal divide between A and B. You’ll “rotate” the problem rather than solve it.

The synthetic link between “5 is the useful limit” and “name 5 people” is perhaps not obvious. It’s just that that that’s what our social brain can really handle. Some sort of speculative cousin of Dunbar number. 

Above/below you get overfit/underfit

This is part of my thesis that a controlled dark age is probably for the best now. The world needs a good night’s sleep. Been “enlightened” too long. Going < 5 = going cozy = going dark. Public spaces only for light entertainment. Take difficult stuff backstage. Breakout sessions

## 75. Moar Trash-talking Singularitarianism

*June 15, 2021*

People always say “smartest people” and “artificial intelligence” in the same breath 🤔

There may be a slight circularity problem in this discourse. https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1404595039318183939

There is no AI alignment problem.

I encourage you to draw the inference that I’m not one of the smartest people you know. 🤣

AGI is the eschatological leap of faith that a series of mottes will converge to a bailey. The big achievement of the AGI thought-experiment crowd (not AI practice) is to label their motte-and-bailey fallacy as a “moving the goalposts” lack of vision on the part of skeptics.

It’s roughly like believing that building better and better airplanes will converge to a time machine or hyperspace drive. The adjective “general” does way too much work in a context where “generality” is a fraught matter.

I should add: I don’t believe humans are AGIs either.

In fact, I don’t think “AGI” is a well-posed concept at all. There are approximately turing complete systems, but assuming the generality of a UTM relative to the clean notion of computability is the same thing as generality of “intelligence” is invalid.

At least the really silly foundation on IQ and psychometrics is withering away. I think the Bostrom style simulationist foundation is at least fun to think about though even sillier taken literally. But it highlights the connection to the hard problem of consciousness.

I’ve been following this conversation since the beginning about 15 years ago, and I feel I need to re-declare my skepticism every few years, since it’s such a powerful attractor around these parts. Like periodically letting my extended religious family know I’m not religious.

It’s interesting that the AGI ideology only appeared late into the AI winter, despite associated pop-tropes (Skynet etc) being around much longer. AGI is a bit like the philosopher’s stone of AI. It has sparked interesting developments just as alchemy did chemistry.

Re: AI alignment in a more practical sense of deep learning biases and explainability, I’ve seen nothing new on the ethics front that is not a straightforward extrapolation of ordinary risk management and bureaucratic biases.

The tech is interesting and new, as is the math. The ethics side is important, but so far nothing I’ve read there strikes me as important and new or particularly unique to AI systems. Treating it as such just drives a new obscurantism.

Previous thread about this from February. Wish I’d indexed all my threads over the past 5-6 years to see if my positions have evolved or shifted. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1363965583860011015

But to the original QT, a new point I’m adding here is the non-trivial observation that those who most believe in AGIs also happen to be convinced they are the smartest people around (and apparently manage to convince some around them, though Matt appears to be snarking).

Circular like the anthropic principle. You notice that earth is optimized to sustain human life. Your first thought is, a God created this place just for us. Then you have the more sophisticated thought that if it weren’t Goldilocks optimal we wouldn’t be around to wonder why…

But notice that the first thought posits a specific kind of extrapolation — an egocentric extrapolation. “God” is not a random construct but an extrapolation of an egocentric self-image as “cause” of Goldilocks zone.

The second thought makes it unnecessary to posit that.

Flip it around to be teleological. In this case, a certain class of people do well in a pattern of civilization. If you assume that pattern is eternal, that class of people suggest evolution to an  alluring god-like omega point and a worry that machines will get there first.

But as a skeptic, you wonder… if this civilization didn’t have this pattern, these people wouldn’t be around worrying about superintelligence. Some other group would be. Top dogs always fight imaginary gods.

No accident that the same crowd is also most interested in living forever. A self-perpetuation drive shapes this entire thought space.

This world is your oyster, you’re winning unreasonably easily and feel special. You want it to continue. You imagine going from temporarily successful human to permanently successful superhuman. Attribution bias helps pick out variables to extrapolate and competitors to fear.

The alt explanation is less flattering. You’re a specialized being adapted to a specialized situation that is transient on a cosmic scale but longer than your lifespan. But it is easy and tempting to confuse a steady local co-evolution gradient (Flynn effect anyone?) for Destiny.

I’m frankly waiting for a different kind of Singularity. One comparable to chemistry forking off from alchemy because it no longer needed the psychospiritual scaffolding of transmutation to gold or elixir of life to think about chemical reactions.

I’m glad this subculture inspired a few talented people to build interesting bleeding edge systems at Open AI and Deep Mind. But the alchemy is starting to obscure the chemistry now.

My own recent attempt to develop a “chemistry, not alchemy” perspective 

https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/superhistory-not-superintelligence

As usual I’ve been too wordy. This is the essential point. Clever people overestimating the importance of cleverness in the grand scheme of things. https://twitter.com/TACJ/status/1404897926577541135

The many sad or unimpressive life stories of Guinness record IQ types illustrates that intelligence has diminishing returns even in our own environment. If you think you’d be 2x more successful if you were 2x smarter you might be disappointed.

It’s a bit like me being good at 2x2s and worrying that somebody will discover the ultimate world-destroying 2x2. Except most strengths don’t tempt you into such conceits or narcissistic projections.

Intelligence, physical strength, adversarial cunning, and beauty are among the few that do tempt people this way. Because they are totalizing aesthetic lenses on the world. When you have one of these hammers in your hand, everything looks like a nail.

## 76. Project managing network effects

*June 21, 2021*

When a proto-network is strongly under your control/influence (eg network of stores you can release a product in, large group of employees you can send a prompt to, fans of a movie franchise…), how do you trigger a network effect?

Can you project manage a network effect?

Trying to “go viral” is a bottom-up guerrilla thing. What’s top-down equivalent when you’re asymmetrically *strong*?

Terms like rollout, deploy, cascade etc exist but point to command-and-control linear scaling alternatives to network effects rather than a network effect per se.

I’m trying to think of examples. I’m guessing DNS propagation is a bit of an example.

You may or may not know the network structure, and that has effects. For eg you may offer 2 choices of computers A and B to employees, and you could negotiate bulk discounts if you knew…

… but individual surveys ahead of time don’t work because word-of-mouth influence.

Can you influence that if you can’t force a choice? 

A somewhat realistic example is Pfizer vs Moderna in the US. Most people could figure out how to get the one they wanted. They chose via WoM.

A “personal network effect” is how you arrange a workspace to trigger network effects in your brain (“inspiration”). A kitchen, workshop, writer’s desk, or painter’s studio should have a complete enough catalytic surface that “idea —> network effect —-> outcome” happens.

A good metaphor is supercooled or superheated water. Small dust particle will trigger phase change to ice or steam.

So managing a network effect = detecting/creating critical states and adding minimal trigger events.

Diff between top-down and bottom-up is you can probably create the conditions rather than waiting to detect and exploit them.

This is basically the OODA loop stated as a graph-theory problem. Create a positive network effect for yourself, and a negative one for adversary. Get lucky yourself, make them unlucky. Latter is a traditional bottom-up network effect, but former is the more top-down kind.

Related... thread on project management and why it gets in the way of this stuff. If you can do what this thread posits, what's left over will be like network effects management. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1405724716506107911?s=20

In general, we need potential field theories of network dynamics that makes OODA usable as something more than an esoteric mandala to stare at till you get enlightened. Both these threads are me speculating about turning a philosophy into a technology through partial automation.

It's kinda funny, but the bete noire of Boydian conflict theory, network-centric warfare theory, is kinda what I'm getting at here. In its original form, it's obvious why OODA and NCW were at odds. It's an evil-twins relationship.

NCW tried to do with a sledgehammer and brute-force technology what OODA implicitly and unconsciously assumes is the soul of human skill. They tried to automate the wrong thing.

In quoted PM thread, I posit a 3-layer thing, and the trick is to automate the middle. NCW tried to automate the top and bottom https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1405601066662522880?s=20

To take a time view of the interplay between network effects, potential fields, OODA loops, and project management... consider the dominance of all those things in your life in a given calendar year, January to December, due to "seasons" of civilized life...

January: high potential energy (PE), medium project management energy (PME), low network effects (NE), low OODA momentum (kinetic energy, KE).

Feb-April: PE goes down, PME goes up, peaking at tax season, NE and KE are still dead in the water.

May -- July: PME down, NE up, PE constant, KE low but starting to develop if you're lucky.

Aug: sudden "wall"... everything crashes

Sept-Oct: if you're lucky, PM low, PE --> KE flowing, NE leveling off. This is the most productive couple of months.

Nov: PME starts ramping again due to budget/planning season, KE slows as you start wrapping up and trying to "deliver" from an organic momentum/network process that isn't suited to "deliverables" so you have to kinda kill it to deliver.

Dec: Everything gets killed again

Notice how shockingly similar this is to the seasonal harvest cycle! There's something to that analogy. Sow = potential, harvest = deliver. Network effect = rains at the right time to promote growth. OODA = managing a healthy crop through growth season.

## 77. Anti-network effects

*June 22, 2021*

What’s the opposite of a network effect? 

Not merely a negative network effect like a contagion or failure cascade. That’s just point of view/subjective. Possibly a positive one for someone else.

A true opposite on the spirit of “the opposite of love is not hate but apathy.”

Here’s an example I came up with. A cauliflower is a physical trace of a network effect.

How do you chop a cauliflower properly? Doing it recursively, “carving reality at the joints” is a negative network effect.

But dicing like it’s a cauliflower is an anti-network effect.

In the picture above, recursive chopping is a way to “hate” the cauliflower topology. It is topology-aware. A kind of love really, though you’re destroying it. 

B is indifferent to it. Dicing into a regular grid like a potato throws away the network effect.

If you actually try, you’ll notice that A takes more time but is much cleaner, resulting in roughly even-sized florets in a narrow distribution with structural integrity. Depending on how deep you take the recursion, you can get median size of florets between 1/2” to 2”.

More than 2”  and you’re not really chopping, more like making small cauliflowers. Less than 1/2” and you’re running into the too-small floret fringe 

This method is good for high-quality cauliflower dishes.

Method B is faster but much messier as you get to the head-surface of the cauliflower. Your dicing grid will be too coarse and the tiny florets will fall apart into crumbles. 

This is terrible. A method that’s only good for horrible, wasteful dishes like mashed cauliflower.

How to generalize this example of dicing a cauliflower as an anti-network effect? Features:

1. It is lossy, information-wise
2. It is fast
3. It creates debris (more pieces than your grid cell count) 

That last feature is a measure of the entropy introduced.

If you take a simple object and make p cuts along one dimension, you get n=p+1 pieces

If you take a “network” object and make p cuts, you can get n> p+1 pieces.

Maybe n-p-1 is a good proxy of entropy?

In 2d with p, q cuts, you’ll get (p+1)*(q+1) pieces with no entropy.

This is indirectly related to the main-cut/max-flow theorem. In a graph, the max flow between two points (source and sink, like root to floret of a cauliflower) equals the flow across the minimum cut. But what happens when you make a *random* cut?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-flow_min-cut_theorem

Here we have to shift from a topological notion of cut (point disconnection of a graph) to geometric, Ie a graph embedding in a plane. A single knife cut on a graph equipped with a geometry is multiple topological cuts using the information of just 2 cuts (2 points define a line)

So to define an anti-network effect

a) define a network as a graph
b) embed it in a space of dimension r (2 or 3)
c) make p random geometric cuts 
d) count number of pieces that result, n
e) anti-network-ness is ~= n-p^r 

(I’m wild-guessing the formula in e based on grid case)

Definitely a rhizome-like effect, so smooth-striated applies as an approximation. But networks I think are qualitatively different too due to the deep recursion. A piece of ginger is like a small tree with < 10 vertices. A cauliflower is like thousands of “leaf” floret nodes. https://twitter.com/deepfates/status/1407362514032238598

You could apply Nakatomi space theory. How would Bruce Willis have dealt with the Die Hard situation if Nakatomi tower had been an ever-expanding warren of ever-smaller tunnels? A cauliflower space? Die Hard 2 was almost that (tunnels under airport) https://www.bldgblog.com/2010/01/nakatomi-space/

Manaugh explicitly connects Nakatomi space theory to Deleuze and Guattari via IDF military tactics in the linked article. But buildings and cities are not quite rhizomatic imo. They have arborescent topologies, and so busting through walls does too.

A cauliflower is a poor metaphor discussing D&G connection since it is literally arborescent. That was just to illustrate graph-chopping. Take a more general graph like the human circulatory system or something. 

“Drawing and quartering” a human is… an anti-network effect.

This is getting a bit esoteric, but one final point. I’m mainly interested in the time dimension. Network effects grow graphs via superlinear processes. Cauliflower ontogeny in terms of branch count is probably something like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16…. or something like that.

The two chopping processes though, look different in time.

A is isentropic but slow. Each cut takes a bit of time, since you process information.

B is fast, and transitions from isentropic to entropic if you work root-to-head, or evenly entropic if you hack randomly.

Edit: random chopping would also be increasingly entropic I think, since later cuts would produce more debris generally. 

You could make a graph of cuts vs pieces to track this.

The creation of debris suggests that anti-network effects share features with explosions of crashes even if they are more controlled processes. I’ll have to think about this.

But punchline… a lot of management is a destructive anti-network effects! 

This is the core of *how* legibility-seeking unleashes destruction. The authoritarian high modernist dices cauliflower like potato. Many visual examples in Seeing Like a State. https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/

## 78. Charismatic Epistemologies

*July 31, 2021*

I've been noodling on an idea for a while that I've been reluctant to do a thread on for... reasons that will become obvious, but let's yolo  it. I call the idea "charismatic epistemologies." Aka... how successful people explain the world, and how those explanations fail.

I've been reluctant to do this thread because it runs the risk of specific successful people I know thinking I'm subtweeting them, which is ironic, because a big feature of charismatic epistemology is believing things are about you when they are not.

My n size for this theory is probably several dozens. I've been around people who are far more talented and successful than me for like 30 years now, and sort of figured out how to free ride in their slipstreams. Sometimes parasitically, sometimes symbiotically.

For a while, I was confused about this phenomenon because I was thinking of it as a minor special case of the fundamental attribution error, with minor additions. No, it's a distinct and richer/larger phenomenon. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error

The FAE is the tendency to explain outcomes based on dispositional factors rather than situational, with a personal bias. As in "you just got lucky, I won by genius... you asked for your misfortunes, I got unlucky."

But the FAE applies to all of us, not just outsize successes.

Charismatic epistemology is what you get when the fundamental attribution error meets an outlier success with a non-trivial evidentiary basis for their own uniqueness/outlier-ness.

A familiar but peripheral example is simple, lazy self-mythologizing, as in a poorly written self-congratulatory autobiography. This is peripheral because it is something of a conscious construction, and the person knows they're doing it at least dimly/unconsciously.

Charismatic epistemology isn't about the story you tell about your *own* success story. It's how you explain the *rest* of the world by extrapolating from your own experiences. This is an egoist bias rather than an egoTist bias. http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-egoist-and-egotist/

EgoTists are boring. Trump is an example. EgoTists not actually interested in the rest of the world. Only in themselves. The charismatic manifestation of EgoTism in a successful outlier person is narcissism. I'm not talking about narcissism in this thread.

Charismatic epistemology is something you get even with self-effacing, non-egoTistic egoists. And here I mean egoists in a broader sense than usual. People who believe they're special in some way, not necessarily "superior," but may or may not want to perform it egoTistically.

The sources of charismatic epistemology may or may not even be fodder for egoTism. Any innate trait or life experiences will serve -- being much taller or shorter than others, race, gender, early childhood trauma or privilege, extreme poverty or wealth, living through wars...

2 special cases of interest:

One is people who've had extreme objective validation of their sense of specialness (scoring genius IQs when young, winning olympic gold at 16, becoming a big movie star at 21)

The other is people who've had experiences of specialness that are extremely NOT objectively validatable but they know from the inside were huge. Enlightenment type altered mind states, periods of deep suicidal behavior, life-altering but not very visible illnesses.

So that's the eligible set. Note that this specialness is not of "everybody has some special shit if you look hard enough." This is actual outlier attributes relative to closer-to-the-mean humans. This is necessary but not sufficient for charismatic epistemology to emerge.

Necessary+sufficient conditions are:

1. Subjectively compelling (even dispositive) evidentiary support for your specialness

2. Outlier success where your specialness is a non-trivial, salient explanatory factor.

3. Tested predictive power of "I am special"

4. Broad curiosity

If ALL 4 factors hold, you might develop a case of "charismatic epistemology."

What are the features of this epistemology?

The biggest feature is: believing the universe works in a way where your account of your own success is Exhibit A. Ie the same laws that you think determined your successes, determine how the world itself works.

For example, if a core belief of your explanation for your own success is "optimism and daring shapes events, and I won because I was optimistic and daring" you'll tend to explain everything else in terms of the effect of optimistic-daring.

Several secondary features:

1. You "do your own research" a lot

2. You are acutely aware/sensitive to the flaws in how other people think

3. When people disagree with you, you look for hidden agendas/backstories first, examine the merits of their arguments second

If this sounds similar to crackpot reasoning patterns, it is not an accident. It IS the same pattern, except that it is accompanied by high success and comes from your own life. For most crackpots, it is sort of "borrowed" from charismatic leaders they become true believers of.

Ie, charismatic epistemologies that are born of successful and "different" people attempting to explain their own lives to themselves "seed" the crackpot epistemologies of... much less impressive people. But let's set that aside. This is not about the crackpot echoes.

One interesting sign of this. The Peter Thiel "contrarian/heretic" question of a "secret" is designed to DETECT a charismatic epistemology at work. But it can't actually tell crackpots apart from the future outsize success types.

So everybody who uses the "secret" question for diagnostic purposes tends to pair it with OTHER evidence to determine whether you're a genuine potential future success or a crackpot. Some people call it "earned secret" rather than just a "secret"

Cf necessary and sufficient... it's bidirectional. If you satisfy conditions 1, 3, and 4, there's a stronger-than-random chance you'll develop condition 2 (outsize success)... and if you have charismatic epistemology, chances are you got there via satisfying the 4 conditions

The mechanics of this are mostly obvious, so I won't belabor them, but one mechanic is worth calling out. The "tested predictive power." People who develop charismatic epistemologies don't just make up just-so self-congratulatory theories about their past. They TEST them.

If you believe, for eg. that having a green-dyed beard is a big part of your success, you'll actually try to prove this, by (for eg) giving important speeches with and without green-dyed beards. And these experiments will prove you right! Green beards lead to success!

Now this is where charismatic epistemologies start to turn cancerous, and any genuine explanatory power starts turning into your personal pseudoscience. Now why might your "green beard" theory prove out?

The thing is, success is non-ergodic! Once you start succeeding, you lose the ability to systematically experiment with your own success factors because it has *already* altered your decision environment!

If you 

a) have a reputation for success, however strong

b) have been telling a story about it with confidence and self-assurance

c) people have believed in, adapted to, and responded to it...

Well... it's a self-validating theory.

This is the "reality distortion field." It takes a while for it to grow to Steve Jobs size and power, but it is visible fairly early on a success trajectory of any sort. I've met enough people "before" and "after" that I've now seen it multiple times.

The more you succeed, the more people around you will adopt complementary patterns of effective behavior to ride your coat-tails, and the more they'll reinforce the theory of success. This will make the next time you tell your story even MORE confident and self-assured.

It's a bit like a stock market effect, where a stock goes up and up and up because more money pours in, and up to a point, actually makes future success more likely.

Notice the positive feedback effect here: you are confidently espousing a theory of success, backed by a track record... the confidence and success attract ever-more talented people hoping to leverage your "formula" to succeed themselves. Proven winners attract likely winners.

The problem here is that your chances of being *right* about the world don't actually increase at the same rate as your chances of *succeeding* in the world. You're going viral like a meme, not converging on an ever-truer theory of the world.

l'il break here for dinner (stuffed arepas 🥳) to be continued...

Ok, to continue. Here's where the crackpot connection comes in. A charismatic epistemology is something like a flat earth theory that's not just approximately locally true, it is increasingly exactly true over time.

This is because success has a "flattening" effect in the immediate neighborhood. The world around you adapts to you through the progressive effect of a strengthening reality-distortion field. It grows to include a core group, a larger group, a company, a market...

Before we examine the implications of this, a couple more pieces of evidence/illustration.

First, the Amazon Leadership principle #4: "Good leaders are right, a lot." 

https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles

This is, in my experience... basically true. Good leaders are weirdly, presciently, right. In a series of uncertain, ambiguous decisions, where rational analysis might expect say a 30% hit rate, they're hitting 80-90, even 100% for brief periods.

This is more than Taleb's "fooled by randomness" effect because it's not like betting on the market. This is "being right a lot" due to the world having arranged itself in your local neighborhood to consistently prove your theory right.

Second piece of... not evidence, but... illuminating narrative false-color from a perceptive observer, Douglas Adams In Hitchhiker's Guide.

Zaphod Beeblebrox goes into the Total Perspective Vortex and, much to the amazement of the others, does NOT come out stark raving mad from having gazed into the void and realized his own utter insignificance (which is what the machine is supposed to do)

Instead he comes out feeling validated: the TPV validates what he already believes: he is the most important guy in the universe. 

The reason, in the book, is simple: they are in a universe that was created for Zaphod so he's obviously the most important person in it.

So successful people develop a genuine local Midas touch that makes them BOTH winners and "right a lot" ... in their sphere of influence/within their reality distortion field. Which can be as big as a large corporation or a third of a nation, and last as long as 10-15 years.

These are crazy conditions, right? No normal human mind could get through the stress of being so much rightness, so much winning, without developing an epistemology based on the locally simplest Occam's Razor: your theory of your own success is right, as far as your eye can see.

Worse, you NEED this epistemology to function. It has to become an efficient System 1, thin-slicing decision system that's second nature, because your success has now created oversubscription.

You have a queue winding around the block, with people hoping your oracular midas touch can do its presciently "true and winning" thing with whatever you're bringing to that success party. You have to apply your success theory in fast-mode, like a trained deep neural net.

To be clear, this is not something ordinary people experience. It's not the normal fundamental attribution error that average mediocre types might develop. It's that on steroids, plus several other dynamics creating a perfect storm of high confidence belief in yourself.

Regular people don't experience this. We are always aware of the zone and strength of our "rightness" and "winning." If we wander outside, we instantly doubt ourselves and incline towards trusting others over ourselves when it sounds like they know what they're talking about.

A person in the grips of a CE, otoh, has to work extraordinarily hard to even find the boundary of their rightness/winningness, because it is so big and comprehensive.

This is the reason, for eg., there's that folktale trope of a king disguising himself as a commoner to wander the city at night to try and see the world without the reality distortion field in effect where his presence alters whatever he's trying to observe accurately.

Now here's where things start to go wrong, due to factor 4 -- broad curiosity. Charismatic epistemology wouldn't lead to problems if it sort of stayed contained within its zone of strong truth. But generative and talented people are rarely that narrow in outlook.

So when they slow down with age or tire of their formulaic success pattern, and let their mind wander to things far afield... they find it really hard to suspend their RDF and walk the streets of reality like commoners in rags.

At this point, it's hard to illustrate what happens next without either making up fake examples, or subtweeting real people which is why I was reluctant to do this thread 🤣

Suffice it to say, their "win rate" starts dropping sharply, and their ability to "be right a lot" requires more and more... epicycles. They never quite get to entertaining the possibility that they're outside their zone.

Prognosis:

-- win rate drops
-- takes more and work to be less and less right
-- theories get more convoluted, with more epicycles, less of that sweet occam-razor sharp elegance

Here a funny thing happens, involving others in their RDF. Haters and critics are as irrelevant to the epistemology as ever, because they've already been proven wrong long ago during the apogee of the CE's success.

But true believers... hmm there's trouble with them.

The thing is, the ability of true believers to do various validating things relative to the charismatic epistemology is dependent on the theories arising from that epistemology being elegant, simple, powerful, and effective.

As the CE starts to get overextended and develop epicyclic clutter, it becomes hard for true believers to even pretend in the Winning and Rightness theater, because it's too complicated now.

A dark cartoon version of this played out, for eg. in QAnon circles leading up to, and beyond, election night. Something very like this happens around every late stage charismatic epistemology that is wandering abroad far from where the world is flat.

The central charismatic figure at this point can react in many ways. 

Some react by progressively cutting off people who are starting to stumble. The circle of "good people" starts to shrink and tighten. More and more people get cut out. It's a LIFO effect.

The healthiest reaction is to recognize what's going on, and *realize that there is no easy way out.* The only way out is to take a looong break where you stop running the success script entirely, and wait for the RDF to wane and dissipate and ultimately collapse.

This will happen because if you just stop using the charismatic epistemology, it will stop feeding large groups of people and developing in strength. My guess is a field that takes 10 years to build up takes about 1-2 years to dissipate.

The only way to accelerate the field decay is to make a radical leap into a new endeavor where your CE is not just slightly fraying at the edges, but wildly wrong in ways that make you a fumbling beginner from day 1.

Many even-headed big successes seem to do this naturally. They reboot in ways that make them a beginner again. A good heuristic for doing this is to find another, equally successful person whose CE is dramatically different from yours.

There's a lot more to say... including about dark descents into hell, phenomena that arise in response like "hater" patterns, Big Man Straussian theorizing cottage industries... it's a whole extended universe.

But I don't want to write a whole grand unified thesis here. So I'll close with a personal angle. One reason I've developed these theories is that I've spent a lot of time around people with charismatic epistemologies, and built something of a career out of pen-testing them.

The reason I have this career is that many in the early stages of success and a modest RDF dimly recognize the risks and want it challenged enough to prevent cancerous over-extension, but not so much that it gets undermined even where/when it works.

Haters and actually hostile critics are like actual hackers in this picture. They’ll actually cause damage if you let them into the RDF out of naive belief in “critical skepticism.” Their anger and resentment will seek to replace the RDF with a self-destructive alternative.

You want someone who is not hostile but also has relative natural immunity to the RDF by virtue of lacking the ability to profit from it. If you were not a talented engineer/designer you’d have been less susceptible to Jobs’ RDF: you can’t work for it, it can’t work for you.

But there are 2 other reasons I ended up accidentally being a connoisseur and wrangler of charismatic epistemologies: mediocrity and social media.

First, I spent ~20y, age 15-35 having my sheer ordinariness and mediocrity drilled into me. I wasn’t right a lot, I wasn’t winning a lot. I wasn’t wrong a lot, I wasn’t losing a lot. I had an average amount of good and bad luck.

For about 5 minutes after making it into IIT (which all of India believes is a Special Thing), I believed I was special. That self-congratulation party ended rapidly when I found myself strictly in the middle of the s distribution and with legit special geniuses all around.

Second, age 35, I became “internet famous” via a viral blog post. And the sheer mind-boggling vacuity and inconsequentiality of that “arrival” served as a vaccine against ever developing a charismatic epistemology myself.

People think I’m humble-bragging or being self-deprecating when I insist on my own mediocrity. It’s not. Do you know what it means to have 45k followers or a blog with a 14y history of multiple viral hits, and many famous friends?

It’s about the same as being a middle manager 🤣

But because people believe internet reputational currency is worth a lot more than it is, you get what I think of as a “fake reality distortion field” or fRDF that can’t actually generate the winning and rightness of the real thing.

I often get mentioned in the same breath with people with comparable social media reputations but a lot more behind it.

One sign: startup rubes sometimes assume I’m rich and approach me for funding. Not intros, actual funding.

Also various requests for magic I can’t perform.

This is like a vaccine. Having an fRDF with middle-manager mediocrity behind it means you get inoculated against developing a charismatic epistemology yourself.

It’s not always effective. Curiously it’s in the online minor leagues that people develop the most CE from fRDFs.

But once you make it to D-list, the sharp disconnect between the optics and the reality inoculates you.

But to bring it back to macro… the world is now awash in Big Man charismatic epistemologies and colliding reality distortions. It is a world of weird epistemic feudalism. There is no banal public epistemology that mundanely pursues rightness without charismatic epiphenomena.

The larger emergent charismatic epistemology that was emanating from Mount Davos has collapsed after Gollum Trump jumped into it with the One Ring — the White House charismatic epistemology.

And with it, 40 years of neoliberal harmony has collapsed into a 1000 warring satrapies.

Haha you thought “science” was the uncharismatic truth-seeking epistemology, but that got TEDified and sucked into its own charisma vortex.

There’s nothing left. No commons-based public domain epistemology to navigate by. Just a Straussian War of Titans bumping RDFs.

I’ll stop here. Tldr: this is happening and shaping the world. It’s neither good nor bad. It just is, like homelessness and nimbyism and religion and droughts and floods and wildfires. Part of the phenomenology of wild earth. Hope you enjoyed the faux-Attenborough documentary.

## 79. True Names and Cantor-Slashing Intersectionality

*August 12, 2021*

Human beings should be like prime numbers. If you can be factored into prime attributes shared with others, you’re kinda interchangeable.

Like husband x father x (founder)^2 x Broncos_fan can be replaced by (husband x founder x Broncos_fan) x (father x founder)

This is what kills intersectionality ontologically. As in, if we get a black lesbian for our movie, we get 0.5 credit for black and lesbian, plus extra credit for cross product. Humanity as unbundled and stacked combinatorial feature vector, then rebundled into Borg cube.

If it’s not in the product space of the legible feature vector, it can’t be modeled. The legibilizing conceit is that the combinatorial signature of included features is all or most of what matters.

Another math metaphor. Treat the True Name as an uncountable infinity and the intersectional identity as a finite or countable infinite quantity subtracted from it. You’ve taken away 0% of what the True Name points to. Your feature vector isn’t all or even most of you. It’s ~0%.

To identify by intersectional identity is to dehumanize. The only defensible pragmatic justification is to counter even worse dehumanization through worse frames. And that only as a temporary measure. To bootstrap towards primal True Name being.

Intersectionality was a short-sighted idea, and the best that can be said for it is that it was perhaps a desperate measure for desperate times, when far too much of too many people was being erased through homogenization.

This is only incidentally commentary on culture war. What got me thinking of this is asking the question, “who is worth winning for?”

The intuitive answer I jumped to was True Named people, not Box People. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1425530879175139335

Ie people who are at, or in the process of uncovering, their True Name, or prime-number, or infinity-nature. Equivalently infinite-gamers.

Let’s say you make a joke and people like or dislike it. If the partition can be nearly exactly described by a feature-based partition (eg “women like it, men don’t”) it’s a Box-people win. That’s why such humor is called “identitarian” and is low quality.

If otoh there is no discernible pattern to who likes it, you’ve found a True-Named joke. The joke can be incorporated into the true names of all who laughed, but in a weirdly entangled way. Your True Name is a function of all things you respond to in a “random pattern” way.

This is an approach to identity analogous to the sieve of Eratosthenes procedure for filtering out composites, leaving only primes. I’m straining at the limits of this metaphor. Throw away anything that’s explainable by legible features leaving only your random residual response.

The set of random/pattern-free pointers to you, is the irreducible residue that defines the illegible core of infinite being, the thing deserving to be uniquely named with a name like Pi. The part that cannot be reduced to a small shell script. Kolmogorov-incompressible kernel.

Now this joke, let’s call it the Perfect Joke. The one that makes a completely illegible random subset of people laugh. No matter how you slice and dice the audience, you cannot separate laughers from non-laughers with a finite set of attributes. Can you construct it?

It is similar to (perhaps isomorphic to) the existentialist idea of a truly random act. Can’t find a good ref for it. 

But this Perfect Joke is an example of what to me is aspirationally the highest art. You’ll never actually hit it, but you can be closer rather than farther.

Btw, subtle trap: if your art repeatedly picks out the same random set, but nothing else does, you can become an attribute (“people who like X’s jokes” becomes a reductive prime feature like “black people”). So you need illegibility of temporal correlatedness too.

I said, in the thread QTed up thread, that the “Box people” who have responded to my writing over the years is basically English-reading middle class. And I do have consistent readership too, so by both measures, my writing is far short of existentially perfect/random art.

But it’s not bad. While I’ve found a few coarse vector features (readership is majority male for eg, and concentrated in the moving 10-years-younger-than-me window), it’s actually hard to detect patterns beyond those. Huge variance on most other variables.

Still, can do better. How do you get more random? It’s not enough to simply stop appealing to the Box side of people. You need imagination to appeal to True-Named side (everybody has both a Box they’re working themselves out of, and a True Name they’re growing into/uncovering).

I’ve made a lot of progress in the last year figuring out what I want to stop doing, and I’ve stopped almost all of it. The harder challenge now is identifying things to start/continue doing.

I recommend this challenge to everybody working in public: discover approximate instances of your Perfect Art by trial and error: things that appeal to maximally random subsets of your available audience.

Some version of this is likely possible in more private lives too.

Seeking out the primality in others is not the only way to progressively uncover the primality in yourself, but is probably the easiest.

Tldr: don’t reduce people; make them more whole. That’s what it means to “see” others — make them more whole, and be made more whole in turn.

The irony is… I think Crenshaw’s original intersectionality idea was actually motivated by a very similar ontological aim. Basically perform something like a Cantor diagonal on finite notions of identity. Except it went badly wrong because of an insufficiently expressive frame.

It was done in a way that strengthened what should have been subverted.

There’s probably a rigorously formalizable version of the argument in this thread but I’m not really interested in crafting it. I believe it enough I just want to use the result somehow.

What I’ve discovered so far about searching for Perfect Joke type art is that you have to filter out or subvert Box features of ideas, and tap as deep as possible into unconscious stream of consciousness to generate primality. Aka, formulaic exclusion, anti-formulaic inclusion.

Primality in work tends to draw out True Named sides of people. Mostly because you can’t dissect the object, the whole subject forms a response. It’s not a feature subset of you that’s laughing.

I’ll define a thing that may not exist: a super-perfect joke that makes everybody laugh. Nobody can resist laughing.

One of these days I’ll vanish past the event horizon of my own latent spaces like time cube guy

Update: creating or responding to perfect jokes make you slightly more true-named in an unpredictable way, breaking with box-predictable past, so even if nominally same people laugh each time, it’s mitigated by them getting slowly uncorrelated from past. More free/random.

So there’s an ergodic hypothesis here. Making 1 person laugh in a random way for n days is like making n random people laugh for 1 day. This allows you to apply idea to non-public work. With just family or an SO for eg. Grow more random together.

## 80. Vegetarian Meal-Presentation

*August 30, 2021*

When high-end restaurants sometimes charge the same for comparable meat and vegetarian items, where the meat is clearly a more expensive ingredient… are they explicitly scheming to get vegetarians to subsidize the meat eaters? 🧐

You can tell when a meat eater has thought of a vegetarian dish. They always try to center a signature ingredient in a meat-like scheme. Usually large portobello mushroom, eggplant nedalki9n, beets, or recently, large chunks of cauliflower.

It’s… okay, but that’s really not how vegetarian cuisine works really. It’s not hub-spoke. More like a balance of 3-4 equally dominant elements. A good strategy is a protein, a starch, and a non-trivial veggie side.

Meat lends itself to an aircraft carrier group type assemblage. An ultradominant core with little things hovering around. The only vegetarian dish where I’ve seen that work well is good veggie burgers.   Less frequently, slabs of tofu or tempeh can work.

garbled word is medallion 2 tweets up

I really dislike attempts to use vaguely meaty veggies in literal-minded meat substitute ways. I don’t like eggplant much, but if I had to eat it, a thick medallion in a Napoleon configuration is the worst form factor.

And a large portobello as a burger substitute is the laziest idea ever. Slice it, create a melange with other ingredients. 

I do think many meat-first chefs are genuinely interested in doing good, imaginative veggie food. They just lack veggie-first orientation.

Trad vegetarian-centric cuisines fail in a different way, by centering a starch. Works if you’re a farmer burning 4000 calories farming everyday, but coma-inducing for modern couch drones.

The worst veg option I’ve ever seen was at a Persian restaurant in Phoenix  — the only thing was a vast pile of rice topped with dry kebab skewer veggies. Fortunately other Persian places do better, with stews.

I think vegetarian food is fundamentally more parallel and random access, while meat is fundamentally serializable. This is why formal, course-based presentation of a series of “dishes” works less well. Vegetarian food wants to be out-of-order/improv/parallel. https://twitter.com/vegan/status/1432401525666680838

This is why even at weddings and such, the formal presentation of Indian food is highly parallel in a thali or plantain-leaf form. There are still 2-3 courses, but with like 10 things in parallel, and only 1-2 elements shifting. True even when meat is on the menu.

Bento boxes and Ethiopian injera based platters work the same way. Anytime meat is decentered, even in meat-heavy cuisines like middle-eastern, things go from serial to parallel.

For eg, the idea of a “salad course” makes no sense in a veg meal — a salad is a thread through the whole meal. You crunch a mouthful to vary the flavor. Papads are not appetizers. They are crunch elements beginning to end.

If you think Indian food is too mushy, it’s because you ate the papads and pakoras at the beginning. At an Indian wedding, you’ll be offered papads several times through the meal.

You may not be served things in the order you’re meant to eat them. For eg. in a south-indian plantain-leaf meal, pickles are served at the beginning in the ritual order in one corner, as is a bit of salt, but both are usually used at the end, to accompany the curd-rice course.

There’s an element of improv expectation. You’re served a mise-en-place rather than a scripted meal. You have to compose the meal yourself to some extent. Every bite can hit one of several notes. In a western serialized meal, it’s at most 2-3 choices (sandwich bite, chip, pickle)

I’m not sure how you’d actually do a restaurant to serve both ways at once, especially at the same table, but I suspect it’s solvable. 🤔

But it does require an element of diner education on alt norms. Like you don’t eat at a dim-sum or family style place the same way.

A thing I’ve noticed in Indian restaurants is people coordinating choices. Lighter, more snack-like meals tend to be more serializable (eg vada or pakoras followed by dosa or puri-bhaji). Either everybody will order thalis or everybody will order the lighter fare.

Did not expect to shitpost on culinary medium-is-the-message principles this morning, but in a bit of a food coma after eating a whole loaded bagel.

Hmm…, a simplified home meal in the western tradition is often a composed 1-course plate, with everything except desert, which looks like a thali. But a simplified Indian meal will eliminate threads rather than courses (eg only one vegetable but still 2 courses — roti and rice)

I think it’s because the courses do less work but more important work, like hot followed by cold which matters more in hot (and more likely to be veggie) climates.

One of the things I’m very curious about is how long it will take postmodern nutrition-hacking diets, based on equal parts bioscience, real science, and alchemy, to develop all the complicated nuances trad cuisines have kinda made tacit (but easily grokkable by inspection)

Here’s an interesting roundup of weird and interesting diets and theories from @dschorno. It’s had me thinking a lot the last few days.

From radical conspiratorial “everything is toxins” body-as-temple diets to weird stunt diets like croissants-only.
 https://arcove.substack.com/p/bear-nation

Personally I enjoy food too much, and venerate body-as-temple too little to ever go full-stack nutrition hacker. I’m fine with body-as-trash-can. Otoh, I have no veneration for trad food ways either. They were once perhaps adaptive under varied patterns of privation, that’s all.

* broscience not bioscience 3 tweets up

I’ve definitely noticed effects of trying modern changes like cutting back carbs, increasing proteins, limiting/eliminating seed oils etc. But I’m broadly in the camp that argues that humans can thrive on a huge range of input mixes.

Diseases of modernity probably have a few fairly specific causes like added sugar. I’m skeptical of theories and diets that demand really comprehensive revamps of entire diets, most of which have millennia of good-enough history and considerable old science behind them.

Like… the Central Americans figured out nixtamakization to make corn work?? Quite astounding scientific moonshot on what must have been a “disease of modernity” back in the day. Entirely non-obvious advanced chemistry hack. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization

So the history of nutrition is probably — treat the body as somewhere between temple and garbage pail, eat whatever doesn’t immediately kill you, address obvious “badness” caused by specific foods or deficiencies via processing or supplementation. Trust the evolved body.

Ayurveda is trad brahscience. As in brahmin science. Very much like modern broscience. It's 10% good heuristics based on gunas/doshas, 40% superstitious bs to dazzle and intimidate the lower castes, 50% self-certain strutting about making specious claims

## 81. Committees vs. Satrapies

*September 11, 2021*

Formal units of internal organization like committees and councils seem to have fallen out of favor except where they are continuing legacies like in politics or old companies. Now we seem to just leave these things loosely structured and call it a “group” 🤔

I haven’t been in a meeting of any size run on a formal procedural basis in like 20y. I think really only board meetings are run that way in the private sector anymore. Public and nonprofit worlds like formality more but I don’t work in those. I’m guessing DAO/NFT people do too.

My dad, an old school organization man type, was always going off to “committee meetings” for both his work at a steel company and stuff he did for the local Institution of Engineers. World of minutes and memos. Some valuable discipline there that may have been lost. 🤔

In our own informal times, where everything is in some uncertain, entangled state in spreadsheets and slack/discord threads, we easily see the risks of rigid bureaucracy and cronyist self-dealing but we easily miss the value of disciplined process.

The closest thing to a modern structured unit I’ve seen is the Amazon meeting: 2-pizza limit, start by reading a longform 6-page document together. Telling that it doesn’t even have a name. It works great btw. We use it for @yak_collective study groups.

There’s also been a shift from stock to flow. Committees and councils are relatively strongly persistent bodies in membership terms. You have to be appointed or voted in. The meetings are cleanly mapped to a hard-to-change standing body. Composition doesn’t change fluidly.

There’s usually a correlation to budgets or permissions. Now budgetary authority and permission to do things (like say release something to public, approve an application etc) tends to rest with individuals. Org man world has given way to a hierarchy of autocratic satrapies.

“Stuck in committee” used to be a thing everywhere, now it’s mainly a government thing. It was a peculiar kind of stuckness since certain decisions could only be made by empowered committees which only met on a schedule, with a formal agenda you had to get on.

In modern managerial culture if a thing needs action fast, you flag it for a sufficiently empowered individual manager who just makes the call. In committee era, the equivalent was convincing the chair to call an “extraordinary meeting” (for the kids: yes, literally called that)

Clearly this is both a faster OODA loop and a more agile one (reorients faster with fast transients), which is why satrapy-stack companies outcompeted committee stack companies comprehensively for 30 years. Thank you Jack Welch and deregulation. Still…something bothers me.

A world of committees when well run, takes itself and its work seriously. It manages risk differently. It tames individual egos. Innovation and competitiveness sucks in committee world, but defense against other kinds of uncertainty is sometimes superior.

Since I’ve been learning a bit about radiation hardened electronics for the @yakrover project, an analogy occurs to me. Committee structure is radiation-hardened org structure. It’s 20 years behind on performance… but it can function in outer space.

For eg Perseverance operates on 1998 vintage radhard chips while the Ingenuity helicopter runs on unhardened modern chips. But Percy is both more mission critical, and unlike Ingenuity, also had to run compute during the Earth-Mars journey in open space.

I have no idea why this is on my mind 🤔

Another analogy. Committee vs satrapy structure is like oak tree vs bamboo strategy for resistance to strong winds. Oak trees will resist rigidly up to a point, but when they topple they’re done. No fast regrowth. Bamboo is the opposite.

Modern stuff is 100% bamboo, in part thanks to Japanese methods. Quick fail/fast regrowth under stress maps to how andon cords and minimizing mean time to recovery (MTTR) work. Oak tree is maximizing mean time between failures (MTBF). Today they are Good and Evil respectively.

Aside: strikes me as weird that Japan, which we tend to think of as a conformist culture, was where this essentially individual-agency style of management emerged. An individual decides to pull the andon cord. An individual supervisor is responsible for acting. Samurai culture?

But… did we throw out some baby with bath water along the way? 

The lean vs fat tradeoff in supply chains is an obvious dimension where we’re doing a double take. Are there other dimensions? Are there regimes where maxMTBF is better than minMTTR?

Where committees>satrapies?

This is well known history for anyone who tracks this stuff. But the Juran/Deming American influence is vastly overstated IMO. Americans making a fundamental attribution error and the Japanese flattering that conceit. The bigger factor was the receptivity of Japanese culture. https://twitter.com/mgrollins/status/1436744963975303172

The decisive factor in what I’ve been calling satrapy culture is chains of individual accountability for outcomes. What agile types call “single wringable neck” but in a stack from janitor to CEO. Committees otoh follow the principle of collective, procedural accountability.

Satrapies are consequentialist: was the outcome good or bad? If bad, who in the accountability chain fucked up? In Japan that person would be expected to put on a self-abasement apology show for the whole company but wouldn’t be fired unless it was an egregious moral failure.

In the US, there would be no apology theater, and that person would be more likely to be fired. And more likely would be a scapegoat rather than the real culprit.

But either way, individual chain of accountability for *outcomes*

A committee culture org is deontological ethics. Whether the outcome was good or bad is irrelevant. The question is, did the stack of collectively accountable committees follow due process, including escalations and exception handling? If not, which *procedures* are flawed?

The assumption is, individuals do the right thing competently and if outcomes are bad, either it was just sheer bad luck or the procedures are wrong. Hence fact-finding committees. In this model, managers especially can never be wrong, only the procedures can be.

Even when individuals “fail” like “pilot error” the focus is on why the procedures didn’t build in protection against that pattern of error.

All the decisive and risky intelligence is presumed to be in the system itself, not the heads of individuals.

In 2015 all this would sound obviously Evil and Wrong. In 2021, I’m not entirely sure. I think committee-based and satrapy-based management and organization have distinct strengths and weaknesses that are more complementary than in zero-sum competition for monopolistic supremacy.

Satrapies btw, for those who don’t know the history, is an ancient org structure. It’s like a cross between feudalism and monarchy with strong elements of clientelism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satrap

The key diff from feudalism proper is that you don’t own your assets or have political autonomy. You’re an agent of the next level up leader and serve at his pleasure. Creates very different dynamics.

One theory of Mughal decline was that it was due to replacement of a proper feudal model (jagirdari system) with a more satrap type system (mansabdari system) by Akbar. Exacerabetes personal profiteering motives. Same happens in overly strong satrapy companies.

When you can’t pass on your wins to your children (= favored crony-proteges in corps) and could be moved around like a chess piece arbitrarily, and potentially killed or fired for a failure somebody above manages to blame you for, the incentive to make bank while you can ruses.

Worst case: everybody above VP is watching stock value and vesting cliffs with hawk eyes, they know they could get blamed and axed arbitrarily for the next fuck-up, the managers below don’t expect them to stick around long anyway. So you solve for lucrative exit not legacy.

The result is, the theater of individual accountability chains actually creates conditions where nobody can actually build, manage, or lead at all, and everybody is looking for the smart exit moment. So risks of failure actually increase.

Is it worth 10xing failure rate simply so there’s always someone you can blame?

Sometimes yes. When the environment is chaotic and illegible, and knowledge is too hard to codify into systems. Which means the person with the right tacit knowledge in their head is priceless.

Under such conditions the system is stupid, the right barbarian wins, so you should keep firing the wrong people till you find the right person with an uncanny win percentage. And you do that up and down the stack. This actually kinda worked ~1980-2010. Hobbesian barbarian world.

TIL about Quaker management 🤓 https://twitter.com/keithb_b/status/1436754910452846597

I think Covid caused Satrapy failures AND committee failures all over the world. Neither systemic knowledge nor tacit barbarian knowledge proved entirely adequate despite all the cross-accusations. And both had successes as well.

State responses worked to the extent long-term pandemic preparedness — committee stuff — produced capabilities that hadn’t been decimated by privatization. Also original R&D into mRNA etc was committee world. Points to committee world.

Bad messaging, slow responses… points off.

Satrapy world gets points for Zoom, rapid rewiring of broken supply chains, high speed transition to remote work, improv mask production, rapid vaccine dev from the basic science.

Points docked for running way too lean, profiteering, stealing PPP, terrible worker conditions.

But I think we’re moving into a fundamentally tougher environment. It is synthesize the two systems or die.

And yeah, DAOs are promising as a synthesis mode, but most people I hear rhapsodize about them seem to have zero experience managing anything of consequence with or without them, in either satrapy or committee mode. They’re code-happy. So I’m just observing for now.

The core problem is psychological, social and epistemic. Not tech. Satrapies solve for special Great Man approaches and they mostly turn out to be ordinary egotists or have feet of clay. Committees solve for ordinary people approaches and stifle genuine greatness where it exists.

My bias is towards ordinary because I think most people are ordinary, including me. The percentage of genuinely great people (either intrinsic or circumstantial) is overstated by a factor of 10,000x especially in the US. For every Steve Jobs there are 9999 Elizabeth Holmeses.

Fun fact, thus thread inspired by mild annoyance at the proliferation of useless collective nouns in English which got ne thinking about the opposite phenomenon where we erase genuine distinctions between collective forms. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1436537458418614277

I’ll leave you with a factoid. There’s 2 collective nouns for geese. A gaggle is when they’re on the ground, a skein is when they’re in the air. In this case, it’s a useful distinction.

Yet another thing to file under “thing I’d turn into a course if I had time off from making money to develop one”

## 82. Moral Curiosity

*September 22, 2021*

I'll take moral curiosity over moral clarity any day. Moral self-certainty is a sort of willful self-blinding in a complex world.

Rants are interesting. I think self-righteous rants are an example of self-blinding moral "clarity" 

But chaotic ones like Lewis Black's comic rants have a streak of authentic moral curiosity to them.

My rule of thumb is -- if a rant is coming from a posture where you clearly see yourself as a morally superior being to whatever you're talking about (even if you do some false-humility moral self-deprecation), your whole rant is suspect.

Moral curiosity is unmistakeable in the business world. It manifests as people being genuinely more curious about moral questions (what does it mean to be/do good) than financial questions (how does money work at such and such scale).

It's not that that they're more interested in *doing* good than making money, but they're more curious about the mysterious of moral mazes than the mysteries of money.

Both money and morality are endlessly interesting and take on entirely new characters at each new scale. "How does money work" is a different question at $100k/year than at $1B/year. "What does it mean to do good" is a different question at 1:1 scale than at 1:billion scale.

Most corporate ethics theater reflects a condition where moral questions have been relegated to middle management. They're simply not being really thought about at all above a certain scale. Money though, is usually thought about all scales.

Truly morally curious leaders tend to run experiments to explore moral dimensions of their orgs at the largest scales they can, in ways that might even cost money -- which they then use their political/charismatic capital to force through.

By contrast, manifestoes, B-corpism, "percent of profits to this cause"... all that is a sign that there is zero moral curiosity in the C-suite, only moral self-certainty.

One reason I tend to pretty much entirely ignore moralizing criticism of big companies of the sort I work with is that the criticisms typically come from people who are themselves morally incurious at *any* scale, and have locked into certainties at a *small* scale.

If they have experience with big orgs and large-scale morality dynamics at all (rare), it is as failed mid-level types. Which is not an ad hominem, but not irrelevant data either.

Their failures may or may not have to do with failure to scale moral curiosity alongside other traits required to wield power and agency at the highest levels of big orgs.

The usual cope is to conclude that everybody who has more success than them is an immoral sociopath, and that they failed due to their piety. Umm. A little digging usually reveals this to be untrue.

Definitely a lot of naked sociopathy and adverse selection on the way to the top, but there's enough live player moral curiosity as well that it is a mistake to conclude that all big orgs are entirely run as cynical extraction machines and power trips.

This is somewhat the case in Wall Street, but not usefully true elsewhere. You'll end up mis-analyzing most large orgs if incentives/profits/power are the only lenses you use. The moral postures, self-awareness, and curiosities C-suite people bring to the party affect outcomes.

I only recently realized this, but looking back at my consulting history, I've never actually worked for a leader with zero moral curiosity. Which is actually very surprising because my primary lead-gen is from blog posts that are effectively paeans to amoral sociopathy.

True moral vacuum type people are

a) surprisingly rare at the top

b) typically concentrated in finance or very financialized businesses (PE turnaround cos are snakepits)

c) accumulating a huge psyche toll that blows up at some point like a time bomb

I make a distinction between generalized criticism and "defense of the little guy" criticism. The latter is a solid place to put a stake in the ground. Liberal democracies only work if enough people prioritize individual rights and welfare as their moral project.

It's also an excellent way to tell principled moral curiosity at small scale apart from lazy ressentiment. The defenders of the little guy will go after very specific issues in specific ways. The ressentiment driven ones will punch randomly anywhere they sense an opening.

Tech companies add a third dimension to the money-curiosity/moral-curiosity design space. There is such a thing as raw tech curiosity, which typically is more fundamental where it exists at all, because it tends to subvert existing moral AND financial notions.

Elon I think is genuinely in this bucket in a way almost no other highly visible leaders are.

The DNA of any top-level leader is some ordering of curiosities. Elon is tech > money > morality.

Failures happen when you're not smart enough to actually deliver results in your preferred order. If you (costly) signal tech > money > morality, but deliver money > tech > morality, you'll bleed leaderly agency.

Facebook's existential dilemma is that it costly-signals tech > money > morality, cheap-signals morality > money > tech, but has actually failed to do truly interesting tech in the last decade in proportion with its reputation and costly signals. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1440723701624807431

By contrast, Google, even though it has kinda degenerated into a comfy bureaucracy, and failed to make money outside its core search/ads business, has consistently signaled its tech-powerhouse priorities and capabilities.

Okay, this is turning into a chaotic rant in its own right, and I should move this to Roam and develop more carefully into a newsletter or blog 🤣

## 83. Information Work Lotteries

*September 24, 2021*

Sufficiently advanced information work is indistinguishable from a lottery ticket.

If you are enough degrees of abstraction and indirection from anything real, you have about the same chance of having say a million-dollar impact on reality as you do of winning a million dollar lottery ticket.

The people who seem to have been happiest through the Great Weirding are the ones who enjoy a relatively deterministic relationship between work and value. You put in effort here, and a predictable amount of value accrues in a predictable place over there.

This is a subtle source of angst. The indeterminacy of locus and extent of value from what you do, as measured by people actually saying they got value, weighted by *your* valuation of them as humans.

One of the reasons I like my idea of baseline "you have no obligation to be interesting or useful to the world" is that it forces you to ask whether whatever you do is worth doing entirely for its own sake, making any value accrual anywhere else pure upside that you don't need.

The moment you link your personal fulfilment to value accrual at an external locus, indeterminacy in the locus, the value itself, and the value to you of that locus, muddy the equation.

And to the extent you can't even observe it, it becomes impossible. Imagine if you were a writer with no feedback loop at all. Everything you wrote went into a blackhole with no indication at all, ever, of whether anyone even read it... would you still write?

Writing in fact throws you into deep end when you start. It _will_ seem like screaming into the void with zero response. If you don't get enough out of it by yourself, you won't last long enough to see anyone else get anything out of it. So if you do it for others, you'll fail.

I'd say on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being "pure lottery ticket," writing nonfiction on spec, with no pay, for general consumption in public is probably about an 8. Fiction is 9. Poetry is 9.5.

Interesting to think of apparent bullshit work (high abstraction/indirection) that's mainly powerpoints and other middle-management vagueware in this light. It's not so much bullshit as aggregated lottery work in a sort of mining pool.

In a 10k person org with say 8k individual contributors, 1980 managers, and 20 executive management, I think the bet is that in any given quarter, at least a few of the powerpoints made by the 1980 managers "pays off" and the benefit is socialized across the orgs.

Twitter is a good example of such a lottery system. Even when you have enough of a following that you can sort of predict how many likes/RTs a tweet will generally have, you can't always predict *who* will like/RT or when you'll get the random viral blow-up.

On certain kinds of tweets you can predict who will see and like/RT, but the algorithm adds enough of a lottery-like uncertainty that it's never really certain. This is why you have 3 basic tweeting styles: for yourself, for mutuals, for the numbers.

If all you care about is the number of likes and RTs, it means you don't really care about who is responding, which means you value every potential respondent equally low, so you need to aggregate a lot.

The other extreme is tweeting for a single senpai-notice-me muse.

I've only ever tweeted for myself. Once I get to know a mutual, I might @ them for specific things. Both the numbers stuff and senpai-notice-me styles leave me cold. Because they ARE both "cold" styles in their own way. Kinda clinically playing the lottery in a specific way.

Playing for numbers is like slots, but with some ability to pick out machines that return greater than 100% (the fortune cookie themes like personal development, startups, crypto...). 

Playing senpai-notice-me is like blackjack. Skilled tactics like card counting are available.

Somebody asked me yesterday what I do with my time, and I said "waste it."

It's kinda true. To the extent that I spend most of my time in extremely lottery-like regimes of information work, I "waste" it.

I've made several years worth of my income via interactions that started on Twitter, so in some sense, all my tweeting is highly non-deterministic "work". But it's close enough to lottery that it doesn't feel like it. I can't with a straight face call it work.

Is it still a "target audience" if you don't actually target them? 🤔

In fact, the more you "target" the less of a lottery it is, which means you have to make it less abstract/indirect kinds of information work.

Many people don't get this. They write articles like "How AI can improve your business" and it reads like pablum and flops precisely because the abstraction level doesn't match the targeting precision. At that precision, you should write something like "PyTorch for Managers."

If you DO want to write something general and abstract about AI and business, it needs to be much less "targeted." Maybe something based on a metaphor, like "AI is the new oil" that will play much more unpredictably than an on-the-nose thing.

This lottery mindset is not the same as a "numbers game" like sales cold-calling or spray-and-pray resume broadcast. There you're pushing a concrete thing and uncertainty comes from competition or unknowns. Here the uncertainty is created by the abstraction of what you're doing.

You could call it transactional uncertainty versus causal uncertainty. In transactional uncertainty, you know how and why value can be created and just need to close the deal. In causal uncertainty, you don't know how an idea can actually create value.

Transactional uncertainty can be mitigated with better communication and improved filtration and targeting technology. Your precision is only limited by things outside of the work itself. Causal uncertainty is intrinsic to the work itself.

Other things being equal, the value of writing is fundamentally more uncertain the value of programming or cooking or vacuuming the carpet. And within wriiting, a philosophy essay has much more uncertainty in value than Ikea instructions.

The "information work" character and degrees of abstraction/indirection are often very subtle though. For eg. I'm trying to build a hobby-scale rover. In relation to any possible place this could have value for anyone else, it is much more abstract and indirect than my writing.

The actual rover, if I ever finish it, is of no use to anyone, not even me. It'll be a toy. The designs *may* be of use to someone who *may* go on to do interesting things. The thing is an extreme lottery ticket. Like an absurd 9.9/10.

## 84. Crackpottery is Impedance-Mismatched Rigor

*October 17, 2021*

Astronomy  >>> Astrology
Chemistry  >>< Alchemy

…but

Big 5 << Myers-Briggs, Enneagram
Generational history < Strauss-Howe

It’s about whether you use empirical lenses to illuminate or obscure

The difference between astronomy and astrology isn’t that one is more empirical than the other. For much of history they were equally empirical. In fact arguably astrology required MORE rigorous and measurement and observation. 

The diff is astronomy has sounder foundations.

Chemistry over alchemy is less unambiguous. More an evolutionary maturity thing, Though both used similar measurement/observation, alchemy simply had a goal that turned out to be unfeasible using the methods they used. You just need a particle accelerator. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-lead-can-be-turned-into-gold/

imo astrology is so fundamentally unsound (serious opinion here though I have fun with it), no improvement in techniques can make anything it says true . There’s no “particle accelerators” to be found there. So it is qualitatively worse than alchemy.

Now Big 5 vs Myers-Briggs/enneagram. So you think that Big 5 having “correlations” where they don’t makes it better? 

Or that the fact you can easily learn to game MBTI to generate any result or that it will score differently depending on your mood makes them worse?

The empiricism is irrelevant because both are equally bad, resting on the lexical hypothesis (roughly, believing that words like “extraversion” point meaningfully to traits and can be measured with survey instruments). See @literalbanana essay https://carcinisation.com/2020/07/04/the-ongoing-accomplishment-of-the-big-five/

If you think data are a basis for choosing the right system, think hard about whether you really should be measuring a spectrum labeled “introversion to extraversion” with p-values and things, and whether better numbers mean you understand the referents of the words better.

Note that this problem exists even in astronomy/astrology. It took a while for people to figure out that “morning star” and “evening star” both point to the planet Venus. Making words mean things in clear ways before measurements make any sort of sense is non-trivial work.

What’s the point of very precise morning/evening star position logs if you’re trying to compute 2 paths for 1 object in a geocentric system of spheres? Your ontology has an extra fictitious thing in it, and your scaffolding is highly suboptimal at least, and arguably wrong.

A trickier example: ancient Indian astronomy/astrology explained eclipses in terms of  2 demon “shadow planets” named Rahu and Ketu. It’s not clear what those proper nouns refer to. It’s not their demonic personification that’s the problem. It’s their ontological ambiguity.

Similarly alchemy era had its phlogiston, pre-relativistic physics had ether and elan vital, modern physics has dark matter. The presence of dubious elements is not the problem. It’s pretending they’re NOT dubious.

Or worse acting like empirical noise can make meaningless concepts meaningful. Ambiguity cannot be resolved by increasing empirical certainty. Higher resolution image won’t resolve the duck-rabbit illusion into clearly a duck or rabbit.

Philosophically rigorous fields progressively clean up ontology.

Philosophically sloppy and/or dishonest fields pretend increasing certainty about ambiguous things creates better truth.

So why do I like Myers-Briggs better? Because given that what *can* be measured is nebulous-dubious-ambiguous, it’s actually useful to explore foundations conceptually rather than empirically. To go beyond using sketchy surveys to point to weasel words that point to some “traits”

There’s an entire “geocentric” theory of personality under the hood. Not just words pointing at each other and statistics. It’s at least *trying* to be about the world. It’s wrong in the right way. It has the right kind of history going back to Freud and Jung.

It has the right kind of ontological trajectory to eventually converge with neuroscience based thinking about the architecture of the brain rather than its socially embodied heat signatures. It’s a “Greek terms for fMRI ghosts” kind of wrongness. It’s wrong about the right things

Big5 otoh fundamentally isn’t interested in personality as a property of brains at all, anymore than astrology is interested in stars. Both are interested in influencing human affairs with whatever authority they can muster, at the most leveraged loci.

Astrologers wanted to influence how kings governed. Big5 wants to influence how bureaucrats govern. Both sought/seek ascriptive institutional authority by complicating techniques beyond amateur accessibility and create and protect *exclusive* access to power.

It is revealing that though Myers-Briggs has a sketchy private corp grifting at the heart of it, the ideas themselves are accessible to amateurs, not policed, and have roots in an older open tradition (Freud, Jung, all the way back to I Ching type divination). It’s honest.

The situation is even clearer in Strauss-Howe generational theory (and other cycle theories of history…, Turchin, hell even Kondratriev and Elliot wave theories). 

Pointing to the detailed “noise” of history to criticize these things isn’t as impressive as you think.

Empirical data are always *about* some theoretical commitments and concepts. If you can’t articulate those commitments explicitly you can easily delude yourself that you’re doing phenomenology rather than “undeclared” (and usually terrible) theory.

Doing actual phenomenology is *incredibly hard*. It’s hard in the way meditation is hard. If you’re doing any kind of pre-theoretical quantitative studies, the chances are 99% (heh heh I measured this to 3-sigma!) that you’re doing undeclared theory, not phenomenology.

Numbers without clearly identified clean-edged concepts they’re about are a “tell” of pre-theory. There’s a reason meditation only involves ritual use of numbers at best, not actual math. If you’re doing statistics you’re doing theory, whether or not you know what theory it is.

The linguistic dimension of this whole line of thought is imo as important as the replication crisis on bad math and experimental design. Follow @literalbanana for this and read this seminal paper on the “generalizability crisis” where the trail starts https://psyarxiv.com/jqw35/

I’m personally less interested in criticism of the bad research (good public service being done there) than in just learning to think better around alchemy-stage topics, where there’s a limit to available conceptual clarity and therefore to the value of empirical rigor.

I’m obviously not shy about this. My main stock-in-trade is obviously midwit-grade phlogistons like 2x2s, memes, weasel words like “strategy” and “mediocre” and so on. So how to play in this swamp without turning dishonest? How to avoid for eg temptation of “Big 5 of strategy”?

My main rule of rigor is: don’t load concepts with more stress than they can bear. Don’t run big surveys and do multiple regressions on a 2x2 invented in a shitpost. Explore it in jokes, free form essays, even fiction. This is a matter of both taste and honest intentions.

Taste is easy to cultivate with just practice. The hard part is avoiding temptations. If you want to land a big 6-figure consulting deal based on a proposal based on a shitpost 2x2… you’re guaranteed to add dishonest rigor to words and numbers.

Honest intentions here can be of 2 types:

1. Don’t succumb to temptation, keep it play

2. Admit it at least to yourself and own the grift. I can respect that.

What I can’t respect is fooling yourself that you’re doing rigorous, research while in denial about grifting

## 85. On Surrender

*October 25, 2021*

Do all traditional religions have a core notion of surrender as a central tenet? 🤔

Islam and Christianity do but I’m not sure of the rest.

Buddhism doesn’t seem to unless you treat refuge/sharanam as an equivalent idea

The Bhakti sects of Hinduism arguably do, though devotion is also not exactly surrender

This may be an axial age development. Benevolence bias in the universe triggered by opting in = surrender.

Not the capricious gods of antiquity, surrender to whom would mean nothing. You’d have to outwit them.

Hmm. Bicameral mind something something. You don’t surrender to a trickster voice in your head, only to an external silent force. Gods who don’t talk back.

Shit I’m converging on Jaynes model via a different argument. I can see why bicameral hypothesis makes sense. Only an introspective consciousness would (and arguably must) invent a surrender-based notion of the divine. So the absence pre-axial-age suggests non-introspective minds

Bit of a bold leap to jump to voices-in-head consciousness as a precursor, but it’s consistent. Though not clear if it’s the simplest hypothesis.

To want a religiosity based on surrender to an abstract divine, your sense of the world has to go from many concrete fears (lightning, storms…) to abstract fear of uncertainty which implies abstract planning etc.

Like in an ancient religion, who would you surrender *to*? The gods are too specific. Surrender to thunder god (oral contract with voice in head) and you’re only safe from storms. You want general amnesty from unknown unknown shittiness in universe. You want god of black swans.

Hinduism is interesting here because the evolution is unbroken. Early Vedic bicameral gods retreat and the abstract unicameral ones and avatar scheme advance by around 500BC. Have your polytheist cake and eat the monotheistic cake too.

Believe it or not I ended up down this bunny trail via thinking about planning under uncertainty and when it makes sense to surrender rather than fight it, cf Dune scene where Paul gives up trying to control the ornithopter in sandstorm because voice in head.

That struck me as a powerful metaphor. I do it all the time myself. Up to a point you fight to increase certainty in plans/contingencies and try to control outcome. Beyond that you let go and sort of dance with the chaos.

Thing is, significant efforts transform you, so when there is uncertainty and ambiguity around outcomes, you don’t know who you will be at the other end. This causes attachment to current self and reluctance. So letting go control is surrender of self to unknown transformation.

So you could say early surrender based religion was the first agile planning tool when Bronze Age waterfall planning by committee of voices in your head failed 🤣

Was unicameral mind the og Internal Family Systems? 🦋🤔

Are we going unicameral again?

So what have we learned?

We have learned that axial age religions are general liability insurance policies

Yeah definitely a convenient development for large states to have a population primed for surrender. Effect rather than cause I suspect. https://twitter.com/0knaomi/status/1452537325259575296

🧐 https://twitter.com/meekaale/status/1452538013184102400

Monotheistic tendencies pop all over the old world around the same time and take over in a few centuries. Contemporaneously with Iron Age proper 🤔

I will now surrender to sleep and sleep on this. Not coincidentally this is how I do most of my thinking. 

😴😴

Successfully nerdsniped myself with this thread on surrender and religion last night. Now thinking about what non-religious forces can trigger a surrender-like ethos.

I think 2 big ones are fossil fuels and Moore’s law. Both have that quality of general benevolence.

Note I made this AM: 

Happiness is unacknowkedged surrender to faith. You don’t know you had it till you lose it.

A force you surrender to has to be a nebulous cloud of impersonal goodwill directed at you and an illegible supertribal group/imagined community you identify with.

The surprising insight for me was that secular booms powered by religion-like faith is probably not attribute to the tangibles. Apollo was inspiring but too tangible and specific. Gold rushes are closer but still too sharp and narrow. You need something vague like Reaganism.

Basically you surrender to a force of serendipity. Reagan’s genius was in getting there via negativa. Convincing people serendipity was the natural state unless the state tried to “help” (8 scariest words etc).

Very few technological forces are this generic, so usually some human narrativization into a progress narrative is needed. But oil and silicon both come close to “naked” religions. No prophets or bibles needed. Raw serendipitous benevolence and bounty of nature. Just add physics.

The relevance of this for today cf meaning crisis is — there’s no point giving people something to believe in (hopepunk, green new deal). You need to give people something to surrender to. Trumpism hit this button hard. It’s not what he offered. It’s the surrender he accepted.

The left has not offered a surrender option since the 60s (hippie/dropout culture). This is why it struggles everywhere to be seen as anything other than authoritarian power grab by a bureaucratic minority.

For those like me interested in a technological surrender option, a new Promethean force comparable to Moore’s Law, crypto, ML, and solar have been the 3 big candidates, all “children of silicon.” None as powerful as the parent.

Lithium is another, but weaker than oil

Importantly, surrender options are not ideas unless they are literal religions. They need a material basis. Arguably Reaganism had a material basis first in globalized trade, then in silicon. Americanism as a 150y old region is rooted in oil.

The US was the OG petrostate for ~20-30y. The only reason it didn’t succumb to the Dutch disease/curse of resources is, it was first so had to invent the oil industry and all the tech. The hard work stayed the curse which descended on later petrostates.

Aside, curse of resources is a degenerate surrender religion. Saudi Arabia’s first religion, ahead of Islam.

So inventing even the finest new secular -ism won’t help solve the meaning crisis. You need to claim either god or physics on your side. A bunch of philosophy or manifestos won’t do.

God is dead, so it’s either reactionary delusions or new physics.

Surrender to technological serendipity is what we usually call a network effect. An unbounded nonlinear upside dynamic hay is unreasonably easy to trigger within a broader physics rising tide (oil, silicon).

This is a satisfying theory and explains why charismatic cult leader types only ever attract a minority of idiot true believers under post-modern conditions. The axial age is long over. Simply claiming revelation and delivering messianic texts is just campy to most people.

Relatedly modern cults are NOT precursors of trad religions of 3021. Conditions have changed. The pristine ground of unicameral minds was only available for colonization that one time. It was the first and last “human resource” fossil fuel. New religions can’t evolve that way.

If I had to bet, I’d bet on machine learning as the new physics force that can drive a new surrender-based religiosity. Just surrender to the inscrutable algorithm. If Moore’s Law is OT Judaism, ML is NT Christianity. Already with eastern (Chinese) and Western branches.

## 86. Rereading Asimov

*November 19, 2021*

Rereading Pebble in the Sky. Not a great book but it has a certain uniquely poignant feel to it, by virtue of being approximately the middle book of Asimoverse. The robot past and Foundation future are equally distant in time, and the story has a certain expansive solitude to it.

Finished Pebble. Last week I reread Asimov’s The Stars, Like Dust. It’s basically a cheesy romance in a “Golden Horde… in space” milieu. I think it was one of the first Asimovs I read as a kid, and then casually reread a few years back. This second reread is first close read.

It’s early work (1951) and pretty weak, but the portrayal of the clearly Mongol-Turkic Tyranni as the antagonists is surprisingly deft and sympathetic for 1951, and arguably far more sophisticated than say Dothraki/Khal Drogo in GoT a half-century later, or even Dune.

The literary quality is crap, but the universal-humanist world-building is solid. While the Tyranni are antagonists, it’s not in a good-vs-evil sense but as sports rivals. They are “different” primarily in terms of tech and military tactics, and governance model, not morality.

The book is basically a meditation on forms of governance — autocracy, manorialism, pastoralism, nomadic-logistics state (aka Mongol/Genghis-Khan model, which was basically a logistics/supply chain empire).

Despite being barely longer than a novella, it packs more variety than Dune, and quickly gets to the essence of each in short expositions. By contrast, I felt things like Dune and GoT take 100x more room to exoticize without getting to the essence of things.

Like, the Wikipedia page on hydraulic empires teaches you more about the subject of Dune than Dune. I think I resonate with Asimov because he devalues luxuriant aestheticization in favor of cut-to-insight, and without messianic editorializing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_empire

The weakest part of Stars, Like Dust, is the silly subplot where a mystery McGuffin document of great power that drives the B-plot turns out to be the long forgotten US constitution. This was editor H. L. Gold’s idea and Asimov didn’t really like it.

This feels like a book-length commentary on the Go-like subtleties of governance, concluded with a triumphant claim that the governance model that will level up the fame is: the guaranteed no-loss strategy for tic-tac-toe! Like product placement for Tea Party types.

Speaking of sporting references, as an aside one of Asimov’s pet peeves was use of sport allegories without understanding. In Pebble in the Sky, he integrated a full championship-grade chess game into the plot (and the plot is chess-like too).

I recall his commentary from an earlier edition I read long ago, something like “I hate when people use imagery like ‘he opened a slashing attack with his rook’… did the rook use a knife or a gun?’”

This criticism applies strongly to supposedly superior literary-aesthetic scifi

Asimov’s plots have genuine elements of sporting strategy, even if simple. It isn’t just cosplay-larp bullshit portrayed in vaguely impressionistic ways. Ditto his politics.

I think a lot of Asimov can be rewritten much more powerfully by removing the editorial+magazine constraints he was working under, taking his extensive commentary on his own learnings/intentions as a guide. He’s surprisingly *not* as much of a product of his time as it seems.

In fact, he’s a lot more modern than many contemporary authors who might superficially seem more modern by having more diversity/gender-balance out of the box etc. That stuff is trivial to update. But lack of good bones can’t be fixed. The best Asimov stories have great bones.

On to reread of Currents of Space

Hehe Asimov foresaw a space future with sporks and food in jellied briquet form factors like those horrifying 1950s jell-o recipes for “salads”

Now halfway through Currents of Space. It’s much better than I remember. Kyrt was the OG spice. Florina is a better Arrakis. The oligarchy of Sark is more interesting than Attreides-Harkonnen intrigues. I only wish it had been 3x as long.

The 3 Empire novels are like a sports training montage. They gesture at vastly more material than is in either robots or foundation. I want more of this filler. I’ll take 10 more empire novels.

I think all the Asimoverse novels by other authors authorized by Asimov’s estate have focused on fkeshingboutbor bridging gaps in the grand arc. I haven’t read any but none seem to fill in more Empire stuff.

Currents of Space is also a transparent retelling of the antebellum South story. Kyrt = cotton. There’s interesting language alluding to King Cotton and also foreshadowing “the spice must flow”

There’s also some gesturing towards silk as a closely guarded Chinese secret, with the counterfactual twist that if Chinese had discovered silk couldn’t be made outside China fit mysterious reasons, they’d have stopped protecting it.

By contrast, Dune’s spice is a mushroom allegory I think, with some vague gesturing at oil. Much less precise. Asimov is not given enough credit for drawing from all sorts of sources. The main Foundation arc is fall of Rome but he clearly drew from many other sources.

Asimov’s MacGuffins also tend to have serious detail. Kyrt is not just a random commodity. It’s nature shapes the tale. The resolution of the plot has parallels to things like nylon disrupting silk. He drew on his chemistry training to make good MacGuffins. See also thiotomoline.

Dune’s “spice” isn’t bad. It is required for hyperspace navigation and is responsible for various mystical powers in the heroes, but I prefer Asimov’s weirdly nerdy fake science detailing.

The main awkward thing about Currents is a race inversion (the Florinians — equivalents of black slaves on cotton plantations— are white and Sarkite plantation oligarchs are dark skinned and there’s a half-assed attempt to frame the story as explicitly not having a race motive.

It doesn’t work, but he tried! In 1952! And managed a story that would probably upset both sides of culture war today while drawing on US slavery history in a critical and sophisticated way where more recent stuff like Firefly goes for the easy uncritical antebellum romanticism.

He wrote these 3 novels in a 2 year burst of inspiration. Remarkable. And found his own humanist political voice that’s clearly distinct from John W. Campbell’s or Heinlein’s.

Flawed human by today’s standards but he clearly tried to write boldly progressively for 1950-52.

This is why, despite his technical inadequacies, he’s a seminal writer. Made the bold genre reinventing leaps called for by the times.

Rereading the Asimov Lije Bailey books after a while. Catching interesting worldbuilding details I missed before. Like this idea that sets up the distant post-Foundation future of Solaria. They eugenicize sociability out of themselves.

Caves of Steel (1953) and Naked Sun (1956) are technically vastly better than the 3 empire novels (1950-52). Remarkable to see his rapid evolution as a novelist but more importantly as a world builder. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1461544106371342337

The thing I’m picking up on in this 3rd read through of Asimov, where I’m trying to follow his evolution as a writer rather than in-universe chronology, is that he was always unconsciously planting seeds for the future extended universe. That’s why it hands together so well.

Here for instance is the seed of the Zeroth Law that R. Daneel formulates later in the 1985 book Robots and Empire which in turn is the retconned basis for psychohistory

But already in The Naked Sun, the basic idea of psychohistory is already there, where Bailey argues with a crackpot Solarian sociologist, Quemont, about quantified sociology laws. Quemont is an anti-Seldon.

I’m not saying Asimov planned all this, but he had an instinct for sowing seeds that he could reap harvests from later. People who think Asimoverse is a lazy set of retcons are basically wrong. This was destined to come together as an extended universe.

And *nobody* was doing this sort of thing back then in 1940-55. I’m going to argue Asimov invented the extended universe, with full speculative world building. And he could because he was building off contemporary science trends. So he inherited narrative harmonies to exploit.

Unlike Sherlock Holmes universe he didn’t just coopt actual reality. Unlike Jules Verne it wasn’t isolated crossovers like Nemo showing up in 2 books.

Asimov is underrated today because his approach has been endlessly critically subverted by everyone from Herbert and PKD to modern writers. But he developed the OG form. Stream of consciousness improv metaverse building across books.

Serious respect. I first read all of Asimov as a teenager in the 80s. Then I reread in 2016 but not closely. Now I’m kinda close-reading, and am impressed. His literary ability improves from crappy to decent over 50 years but he was never a prose stylist. But world building… wow

Arguably Asimoverse is a superior achievement than Middle Earth. Bones of multiple real histories, flesh of multiple speculative science trends, efficient but not overwrought skin of plot and character, real imagination in grand arc.

In many respects he has never been topped and more recent works regress to the more primitive forms that existed before him. Like Guardians of the Galaxy is Flash Gordon grade. Fun but not exactly complex or deep.

Actually I got it backwards. Foundation was written as short stories in 1951 so psychohistory was already a defined idea in-universe 5 years before Naked Sun. So the unconscious connection weaving went the other way, backwards in-universe shaping the robot murders.

Now into The Robots of Dawn.

Struck by weird predictive misfires in Asimov. The main futuristic storage medium is still film. They have “book film viewers.” They have phone booths even as late as The Stars, Like Dust. 

What made wireless+digital tech so hard to see in 1950?

In Naked Sun, cryofreezing of eggs and sperm is not anticipated but ex-utero fetal development exists, so the premises of the society are weirdly screwed up.

Somehow the internet was a major blindside for people. It is implied that the robots have radio communication on Solaria and there’s a sort of VR telepresence but nothing like a proper internet. Computers are accessed like libraries.

Vannevar Bush envisioned the Memex (on microfilm) back in 1945 but it was still too hard to imagine how computers, digitization, and radio would converge. The comms imagined all sounds like analog radio. Including “sub-ether” futuristic hyper spatial comms.

First proper minicomputer in 1961, first internet link in 1969, but first true science fiction envisioning the internet only in 1984, with neuromancer, 15 years after it was created in rudimentary form. Why the huge lag? What caused the blinders?

Robots of Dawn is as thick as Caves of Steel and Naked Sun combined. I have a 3-in-1 volume. And iirc Robots and Empire is even bigger. World inflation.

Same with Harry Potter. Is it a general rule that big world builds have increasing volume sizes? Though Asimoverse has 4 start points.

How did I miss that Dr. Hans Fastolfe, inventor of Daneel, also dreamed of psychohistory? Giskard and Daneel got the idea from him I guess, and Daneel kept it alive till he met Sheldon.

Finished. This reread was interesting. Written in 1983 this was 25 years after Naked Sun in 1957. The last 2 robot books and the last 4 foundation books were all written in the 80s and 90s. So Asimoverse was written in the 59s and 80s. What was he doing in the 60s and 70s? 🤔

If you look at the chronological bibliography it looks like Asimov doesn’t the 60s and 70s mostly writing pop nonfiction. I’ve read a bunch but damn didn’t realize he’s written so much and f that. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov_bibliography_(chronological)

* so much of that

The Gods Themselves is the only new novel in the 2 decades 🤔

His short stories too show a slow down. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov_short_stories_bibliography

So basically a furiously productive phase from 1939 to 1957 (ages 19 to 37), then a really long 25y sabbatical into nonfiction till ~1982 (ages 37 to 62), then a mature late life burst age 62-72 wrapping up his peak work neatly in a bundle with 6 keystone novels.

This is fascinating and encouraging. That you can come back to 25 year old material and really level it up.

Robots of Dawn is not great. Lots of kinda unnecessary sex-fetish stuff. Too much exposition. And looking now from a technique perspective, R. Giskard is a bit of a deus ex machina. He ties up every loose end in Asimoverse and is way too powerful. More so than Daneel.

Still, it’s elegantly done and Giskard is a well-crafted character. Despite being basically the closest thing to a god in Asimoverse, he’s kinda interesting.

On to reread of Robots and Empire, the main keystone book.

The cover of robots and empire, 1986, is kinda silly. But definitely very 80s. AFAIK the robots depicted have no relationship with the story.

Oh hey, Asimov articulated the Thucydides trap in 1985, 27 years before Graham Allison did in 2012. Also the use of the word “crisis” suggests he was thinking of this as the Zeroth Seldon crisis: intuited by Bailey and solved by Giskard. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides_Trap

Didn’t pick up on this in previous read, but this book repeatedly emphasizes Baley’s uncanny future prediction instincts that weren’t mentioned in previous books. I think Asimov was kinda retconning protopsychic second foundation genes into Baley. I bet he’s Raych’s ancestor.

This is a character continuity glitch. In previous books. Baley is a bit of a present focused type. He picks up distant future arguments from others.

Close reading genre fiction is so much more fun that close reading literary fiction

Much of Robots and Empire is Daneel and Giskard standing around bearing witness to unfolding history. A great parody version would be something like mystery science theater with only robots

Some of this connective is a bit too on the nose. Giskard infers basic premises of psychohistory watching Gladia whip up a crowd on Baleyworld and concludes emotional contagion makes bigger crowds easier to control than smaller ones or individuals. Talk of autocatalytic effects.

There’s some clear influence of 80s chaos theory in Asimov’s last books. Quite explicit in the Foundation preludes. Late retcon as opposed to 80s authors who used stuff like Prigognine’s physics as a starting point.

The Ljje-Daneel bromance is really overdone in this book. Very heavy handed. I’d forgotten the deathbed scene, but this book really sets Lije Bailey up as the of prophet of psychohistory. Like Moses to Seldon’s Jesus or something.

The plot of Robots and Empire involves the three mile island disaster as the trigger for Earth’s turn away from fission power. It was written in 1985, 6 years after the accident and a year before Chernobyl.

If the book had been published just a little later, Chernobyl would have made way more sense as the historical reference point. Funny how such plot choices date a book and the future it imagines.

Finished. The ending still packs a bit of an emotional punch on the reread. 

Much of the book is long dialogues between Daneel and Giskard as they solve the mystery, but with way more philosophical commentary than I remember. This is basically the theology book of Asimoverse.

I now kinda want to read the newer non-Asimov Caliban trilogy books that fill in the gaps between this and Foundation. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov%27s_Caliban

## 87. Big Frontiers

*December 27, 2021*

By analogy to “Big Data is when it’s cheaper to store data than decide what to do with it,” (George Dyson) 

you could say 

“Big Frontier is when it’s cheaper to experiment with something than determine if it’s a scam”

It’s the flip side of brandolini bullshit asymmetry principle: takes 10x effort to refute it than produce it. The solution is to not try: just cap downsides of buying into bullshit and let the upside from legit things swamp it out.

The biggest risk in civilizational cores is being scammed. The biggest risk in frontiers is not playing.

In cores, the only winning move is not playing. In frontiers the only losing move is not playing.

Cores distribute unpriced negative externalities in proportion to inability to resist. Frontiers distribute them in proportion to unwillingness to play.

Core or frontier, the world is never fair. Yes there are people who will get screwed over at both loci. Quite frequently by people pretending to champion their cause.

One of my medium-confidence conjectures is that intelligence is actually maladaptive on sufficiently rich frontiers. Due to various effects like the double morton effect that lead to survival of the stupidest... for a while https://www.science20.com/hammock_physicist/survival_stupidest-77846

In civ cores, intelligence is adaptive because because uncaptured upside things are rare to non-existent by definition, so spotting scams is a net benefit by limiting losses. Intelligence also helps you win by "not playing" stable rigged games of zero-sum extraction.

I'm mostly a creature of the core, but I realized long ago that successfully spotting and avoiding all the zillion exploitation traps at best adds up to not losing ground. You don't gain any. Cores are set up to reproduce starting positions generation after generation.

A stagnant core has rising inequality precisely because 90% people are slowly losing ground through failing to avoid being extracted, 9% are maintaining position by "not playing", and a 1% minority is gaining ground.

A frontier is essentially a social equivalent of a random number generator crossed with an amnesia machine. Inherited core advantages are sharply devalued, intelligence turns somewhat maladaptive, and mostly outcomes depend on being bold enough to play dumb luck games

The outcome is still inequality, but it is not strongly *reproduced* inequality. The 90-9-1 distribution is not a strong function of the corresponding core distribution of the core that the frontier draws its population from.

This isn't "merit" but it isn't faithful reproduction of inherited wealth and privilege either. There is effectively a bunch of social mobility due to the random-amnesia machine.

## 88. Efficient Storytelling

*January 1, 2022*

Storytelling has gotten so damn efficient due to screen media. A well-scripted modern TV show moves along incredibly briskly. It’s like Lean Storytelling. Shortest path through the beats of the hero’s journeys. It’s barely even writing. It’s amygdala assembly programming.

Nothing forces efficiency more than knowing every minute of screen time is costing 10s to 100s of thousands. No time to dawdle. Can lead to mechanical effects sometimes, but damn the machine works.

Slick is the word. It’s not always good storytelling but it’s slick.

Wonder if there’s a way to measure this. The Expanse, Stranger Things, Cobra Kai have struck ne as especially brutally efficient.

It’s like tourists on a package bus tour in Europe. “If it’s Tuesday it must be Brussels” type pacing.

It’s the sign of a mannerist late stage or something. Like we’re on the cusp of a leap out of this local minimum with a young new kind of storytelling that can afford to be sloppy and loose because it makes big gains on an unexpected vector.

Funny how people think this is either obviously a bad thing or obviously a good thing. 🤣

Can’t just let it be a thing huh

Examples: Cobra Kai, The Expanse….

Not a single missed beat or sloppy discursive scene. No spezzatura. No weird narrative conceits overindulged.

## 89. Experts Trilemma

*March 27, 2022*

The expert’s trilemma 

Express doubt you feel and get lynched now

Express certainty you don’t feel, turn out wrong, get lynched later

Express certainty you don’t feel, turn out to be right, get celebrated, be expected to be right forever about everything on pain of lynching

A layperson is an idiot who expects to sustain supreme confidence about everything forever without ever learning anything new, by rewarding or punishing others for being right or wrong.

Expertise *is* the capacity for cultivating systematic doubt about an area of knowledge and responding skillfully to it. Trafficking in certainties is mostly a game for children. For adults there are no certainties, only bets of varying risks. https://twitter.com/GnomesMindverse/status/1508147989906444293

No the problem is never taking responsibility for the risks of life and always trying to externalize risk to others. A layperson is not defined by degrees or depth of knowledge, but refusal to participate in epistemic risks individually or collectively. https://twitter.com/trobuling/status/1508148879304318985

Mutual accountability between adults where everybody has a stake and could be wrong in ways that hurt others is great. Accountability as a clumsy theater for pursuing vendettas, or denying responsibilities for risks you externalized, not so much. https://twitter.com/trobuling/status/1508149417811005449

The experts vs laypeople war has been going on for 25 years now. The new dynamic is the rise of people willing to parlay a tiny bit of rightness into careers of self-righteous populist alt-expertise. Basically riding third leg of the trilemma to profitable grifts while they can.

The recipe is simple and is basically shorting the majority expertise market. Take contrarian positions on a variety of things, if one pays off, ride the resulting popular acclaim as long as you can, and get out just before your luck runs out and they turn on you.

This is why being a contrarian heretic is such a popular thing. Especially if you can buy your own bullshit long enough to feel self-righteous about it and make compelling rabble-rousing speeches. It’s method acting.

This is why I have started evaluating thought leadership entirely by the quality of the followers. If you mostly attract zombie mooks it’s a clear tell that you’re parlaying the third leg of the trilemma into an epistemic bubble.

I used to mainly hold the the grifter alt-experts responsible for pumping up the internet of beefs and rallying mooks to their banners. I’m starting to shift the responsibility to the mooks themselves. People get the “leaders” they deserve.

Another tell is that good-faith experts find interacting with laypeople burdensome because they find the weight of the trilemma to be too much. The only way to win is to not play. They vastly prefer discussing their doubts with peers to packaging false certainties for the public.

The grifter expert by contrast, will eagerly seek public validation, and attempt to massage narratives of their own never-ending rightness to sustain them. You’ll almost never hear them speculating aloud about stuff they’re uncertain of, asking non-rhetorical questions, etc.

They’ll also actively avoid seeking peers with whom they can usefully process doubts. Too much of a threat to managing a self-certain psyche to expose your doubts to even friendly, curious scrutiny. Instead they are more likely to form cabals of shared certainties. Ie religions.

Good builds in this reply thread https://twitter.com/alexisgallagher/status/1508161688104681472

I was also calling this phenomenon entrepreneurial expertise, but venture expertise is perhaps better. It’s more investment in a portfolio of ideas than in building out an idea product. Either way, bad model for cultivating “expertise” https://twitter.com/krishnanrohit/status/1508163062880210946

If you’re wondering why, you might have startup-derangement syndrome. If you’re more interested in “customers” in a “market” for a “truth product” than in actually understanding a topic, you’re going to fall victim to this. Traditional experts are not immune (cf TED talks)

I mean think about it… while the masses might be affected by the products of expertise for better or worse, they’re not the target audience *for* expert knowledge. Sure the knowledge itself should be open to all willing to do the work to access it, with or without credentials…

… but actively seeking to package it (and not in an appropriately caveated pop-science/sci-comms way) for their consumption in order to claim their incompetent support as some sort of social proof of rightness that you ride to riches. That’s bad karma.

Productizing expertise for mass consumption has all the moral hazards and fragility risks of financialization. If you’re an expert with entrepreneurial ambitions, make a product the masses can actually use out of it.

Yep. Ortega was the first to notice a lot of this stuff. https://twitter.com/PlagueofCustom/status/1508171914564538378

## 90. Curiosity vs Interest

*April 6, 2022*

Some people seem to have 100% interests and 0% curiosities. You can be a good advocate with that personality, but not really a researcher.

Interest is about the values of the subject, curiosity is about attributes of the object that can evoke interest in someone, not necessarily you. There’s a whole dynamic of

“What are you looking for”

“I’ll know when I find it”

To curiosity

Curious people necessarily have somewhat flighty attention because the yield of interestingness that captures *their* interest is low. 

Conversely, they’re interested (ie value) in what others do *by default* because they recognize it might yield interestingness for *them*

Never met a good researcher who is highly possessive of their own curiosities and default indifferent or hostile to others curiosities. It’s like going to the market with goods and money but determined not to buy/sell. Curiosity doesn’t work that way, but established interests do

Interests are zero sum at best, usually negative sum. You can only see things that already have established value (positive/negative) to you. Curiosities can be positive-sum. The most interesting things uncovered by curiosity have aspects that are interesting to almost everybody.

Not quite, more like pre-valuation/post-valuation modes of engagement.

I’m *curious* about what the James Webb telescope might see, but may or may not find it interesting once it is revealed

I’m *interested* in the stock price of Tesla https://twitter.com/fenris23/status/1511502287490879488

Any new thing you uncover will have broad or narrow interest once it’s uncovered. X% will find it positively interesting, Y% will be indifferent, Z% will find it negatively interesting (ie see reasons to be hostile)

For fertile discoveries, eg wheel, X>>Y>>Z>0

Z is never zero

Fertile discoveries proliferate and spawn more discoveries because many people are positively interested in them from many angles for many reasons, and trade ideas with each other. The generative vigor is a mark of the original idea being high interestingness, not a conspiracy.

When X>>Y>>Z, ideas kinda explode in revolutionary ways. When they don’t, all the money and top-down power in the world won’t make fetch happen

A clear tell of a person with 100% interests, 0% curiosity is that they resent such outcomes and act like attention allocation is entirely a function of money and “ought” to be reallocated to favor their prefigured interests. A social determinist command economy mindset.

The history of discovery is littered with command economies trying to make fetch happen by moving money around. It’s not entirely ineffective — it’s just a force that’s completely overwhelmed by intrinsic interestingness-generativity of new things in the world

Trying to fight the natural interestingness patterns of what nature reveals, one piece at a time, (which has unfortunately come to be known as ‘what technology wants’) is a kind of deep hubris. Ironically, the accusations of hubris usually go the other way.

It’s not that money doesn’t matter. It matters a LOT. It’s just that it has massively amplified effects when it follows the natural grain of interestingness revealed by open curiosity and efficiently wasted when it tries to follow “interests”

I generally flip the bozobit on a person if they reach for the zero-sum complaint: “attention to X is detracting attention from Y”

It means they’ve never stopped to ponder the attention dynamics of interests and curiosities, or even looked at the world without an agenda.

Sure, it takes surplus attention, a kind of abundance born of privilege which may or may not be deserved, to be curious without a governing interest, but being mad at that and expecting scarcity to have the same effects as abundance is… weird.

For better or worse, the world evolves when people get curious about something and decide to fuck around and find out what happens when you poke at it. And yes sometimes the people who fuck around aren’t the people who find out. But nobody has yet found a better way.

This thread is both a long subtweet of a specific provocation, and thoughts on a repeated pattern of interests without curiosities that is kinda endemic in modernity. This pattern has a right to exist of course. You just have a right to ignore it and play in the curiosity economy

Curiosity doesn’t preclude obsessiveness, in fact the two feeding on each other is what makes for generativity https://twitter.com/joonian/status/1511514081139769352

Tldr: What you’re curious about will nearly always lead to something of interest to somebody, even if it’s not you and you vacant find them 

What you’re merely interested in will usually lead to nothing of interest to anybody

Feed only your curiosities and your interests will often take care of themselves and you might even generate surpluses to look out for the interests of others who might lack the resources for curiosity

But feed only your interests and you’ll starve both curiosities and interests

Academia would get 10x more interesting in 5 years if they asked faculty candidates for statements of research curiosities rather than statements of research interests

When you know both the likely valence and magnitude of the outcome of an uncertain action, you’re solving a problem

When you know the valence but not the magnitude you’re pursuing an interest

When you know neither, you’re pursuing a curiosity

Archetypes: insect, dog, cat

This train of thought are me realize why I think “bring your whole self to work” is bs. It is code for “bring all your established interests, leave your curiosities behind” because your curiosities are your incompletions; ways in which you are not whole

If you have many curiosities, in the context of those curiosities, you’ll always look like an absurd cartoon. If you leave them out, you’ll look like a different sort of  grim caricature, defined entirely by interests. A set of representations without an actual live presence.

This is why sitcoms are better than dramas

## 91. Keep Twitter Mediocre

*April 14, 2022*

Football stadium is a better metaphor for twitter than public square. It’s just that the field itself is shrunken to nothing and the spectator sport is watching the stands across from you.

National Sousveillance League.

This is not a freeze-peach buyout proposal so much as a “use the stadium for hockey instead of football” type proposal. But since there’s no actual arena in the center, it amounts to “sell tickets to my kind of people and encourage the current fans to go build a different thing”

It’s a private sports league company, so they can do what they want, and I’ll take my stock cash-out and go, but I am pretty sure that more people want to play the current sport than the one Elon wants to see being played here, which means net shrinkage not expansion

I mean there’s a reason besides technical incompetence that things like Parler and Gab never really took off. A right-leaning thing that panders to free speech conceits of the classical-liberal-to-fascist half of the spectrum is a really boring non-spectacle

He’s a genius and I hodl Tesla, but I wish he’d stick to cars, rockets, etc. He’s a huuuge twitter whale who sees a very distorted imperial-scale-view of the action (he’s in the lowest row of seats that’s where the center of the field would be if there were a field)

You and I are somewhere halfway up stands based on number of followers. If you superimpose political compass on the stadium, I for example am in 50k circle of seats, roughly at 7 PM lib-left position. Most views are like mine: non-degenerate azimuth/altitude. Elon is at ~(0,0)

But what is sending serious alarm bells off in my head is that “free speech” in the last decade has never meant what it seems to. It is shorthand for “people I find annoying should shut up and people I like should get free *reach*”

The speech/reach conflation runs really deep

The paradox here is that I suspect most people are natural conservatives and the right of center half of the spectrum is actually 70% of the mass. But this is also the reason most people struggle with actual free speech as opposed to lofty mimetic posturing around their monarchs

In its current form, twitter probably serves the left half of the spectrum slightly better, and therefore 30% of the population. In the thought experiment where the game rules favor the other half of the spectrum/70% of the population, I suspect the sport would kinda implode

This is because the right half of the spectrum has odd views on “causing offense” that I think don’t scale beyond a small, homogeneous group that largely agrees anyway. And if they don’t the disagreement is so severe you rapidly get genuinely violent outcomes like war.

Homogeneity is a barbell condition. If you have say, a bunch of 19th century European Christian white guys in wigs arguing, potential for verbal offense is pretty low, until it suddenly jumps high enough for world wars. There’s no middle ground of actual disputation.

Left discourse only seems ultrasensitive to offense because it actually accommodates serious real diversity in a way grifty corp DEI programs pretend to. Despite its limits, twitter is basically the only place where I’ve met people from far beyond my limited circle of homogeneity

Left discourse norms (not far left, plain shallow mediocre virtue signaling leftism without particularly deep convictions or agendas) are the only ones that have been shown capable of scaling to date. That doesn’t mean other norms can’t scale. I just don’t think Musk-norms can.

Musk’s proposal, besides being a Meme Stock Pseudoevent from Hell that has ruined poor @matt_levine’s vacation, is also an actual idea for alt-norms whose outlines are clear from his public behaviors. To his credit it is not pure reactionary fetishization of 19th c European norms

We have to be careful not to conflate what Musk clearly wants from what the Retvrn to Powdered Wigs and Statue Heads crowd wants. There’s elements of the reactionary to what he wants… but he likes jokes, memes, shitposting, and many other things that make modern twitter

Ie there’s four norm sets competing for dominance here

A: Shallow diverse-liberal (incumbent)
B: Musk-weirdness
C: Retvrn to Powdered Wigs
D: Woke Thought Police Stalinists

So basically Musk wants to replace A with B, riding the moral panic C feels over the threat of D

There is a particular risk and a general risk here.

The particular risk is that Elon is not a god. He has incredible strengths and average weaknesses. I hold TSLA and would buy SpaceX in a minute if it were traded. He’s incredibly strong on that sort of stuff.

But on this…

…all the evidence suggests he’s average-weak. He’s not particularly “good” at twitter even as a user, let alone as a social platform designer. He just has extraordinary leverage for ordinary levels of shitposting skill thanks to Other Factors™ that are NOT social.

In fact, his following is built on the spectacle of *literal rocket launches*

The fact that he memes is irrelevant to the point of being a rounding error. 

You and I meme to grow reach. Elon launches rockets.

The general risk is of course that whatever his unique strengths/weaknesses, he’s also a super-billionaire

If you think super-billionaires simply buying up large social phenomena to “solve” them because they don’t personally like the emergent behaviors, you’re a monarchist

… *even* if, despite all odds, he is successful with twitter (and I hope he doesn’t want to be; this has gotten serious now), it’s a bad precedent.

Even if you concede that twitter is somewhere between poorly managed and mismanaged (I don’t actually), this is a way to worsen it

First, it’s not a “problem” to be solved. It’s an ecosystem to be managed/stewarded. There’s no Mars base or EV transition end game here. Twitter’s value is in sort of continuing and evolving indefinitely like a rainforest. “Solving” it is a pure authoritarian high-modernist goal

Second, because of its unique role as a media thing, a management mode that’s not public in some way is simply not credible. I don’t mind a strong board/leadership and activist investors. I’d just like it to stay publicly traded.

I mean look at the NYT.

In general, it is bad for liberal democracies if the actual challenge of keeping them liberal and democratic is outsourced via privatization to an eccentric individual billionaire to do illiberal and undemocratic things with.

I do think liberal democracies and their institutions (and twitter is one, as are literal football stadiums) can get trapped in local minima, and sometimes need an external kick in pants to break out. I think things like space programs and pandemics serve that kind of function

A monarchist believes in a very particular source for the “kick in the pants” external force liberal democracies need: identify god-emperors to elevate above the rule of law. There is a certain deep appeal to this “solution” that hooks Straussian Great-Man theists in particular.

Me, I’m much more in the Terry Pratchett’s Sam Vimes camp: anti-monarchist on principle. He’s descended from a guy who assassinated the last king of Ankh-Morpork, turning it into a neoliberal shaky weak rule-of-law oligarchy that only works because the top noble Vetinari is wise.

Elon Musk is talented, but his talents are not exactly those of Lord Vetinari, which would be the *minimum* I’d look for

I mean if you think you need to take Twitter private to “solve” it and it’s supposedly the town square, logically you’re just delaying the actual big move: taking Congress private to “reform” liberal democracy… which is what Putin did to Russia and Trump wants to do to the US

If you can’t fix Twitter while it’s public you can’t fix the larger problems twitter’s are a microcosm of anyway. So why bother. Let twitter remain the true microcosm of larger problems at least.

Aside: good evidence of my “70% are natural conservatives” is actually Facebook, which is far larger and solves the scaling problem by letting people atomize into relatively homogeneous groups and messaging groups, rather than actually discoursing in one big public space.

Also 70% is actually only reflects the US. Most of the world is 80-95% trad. Non-white countries like India are way more trad-conservative. Immigrants here are far more conservative than you might think, and tend “left” in the US mainly out of anti-majoritarian fears, not values.

This makes this reform “solution” even more dangerous on a global scale, not less.

Maybe this is worth saying explicitly — ownership is a kind of speech. Public ownership is a kind of free speech that is more important than mere words.

However nominal, the ability to own even a minuscule fraction of a company and vote with your dollars is partway to just being able to vote in an election. There’s room/need for things in all positions of the spectrum from completely privately owned things to public utilities.

The notion of free speech in a world where everything worth anything is privately owned is sort of vacuous. It’s empty blather at best, and something that will get you thrown in a Putinesque prison at worst.

If you give people the right to say absolutely anything they want, while taking away more and more of their right to *do* anything of consequence because all the means are in private hands, have you created a free speech utopia or an empty speech dystopia?

I see some comments along the lines of if nobody can technically be thrown out via terms of service etc (eg trump) you get some sort of true utopia. It parallels the bitcoin maxi type argument. In practice, when the terms of service are absolutist, you get a lemon market.

Ie, bad actors chase out the good. In economics, bad money chases out the good. The place to fight for freedom is at the level of the whole society, ie government. Any subset like Twitter that tries to larp “rule of law” through terms of service simply enables lemon markets

Exit vs voice applies. People only fight to create healthy cultures of voice under if they can’t easily exit bad ones.

The place to fight free speech battles is Congress/Supreme Court. If you lose there, what you get is an actual refugee crisis of people exiting entire societies

If you disagree with things like privileging CDC statements over random “do your own research” advice… I mean, there’s a way to address your concern: run for office, get a bill through to reform/dismantle the CDC etc. To his credit, Trump took his grievances to the right arena.

I’d say 70% of the actual issues this crowd is moral panicking about is just work-in-progress large scale monitoring-and tagging algorithm design, weak/understaffed due process for appeals, and a feed algorithm with weird biases that don’t map clearly to political lines

It’s a case of an Altavista era of social waiting for a Google-level algorithmic innovation, not a shadowy woke cabal seeking Total Societal Control. If you want to solve the problems twitter is a microcosm for, run for office. If actual twitter problems, study algorithm design.

Tldr: Elon is gonna Elon. He’s a force of nature. But you get to choose your ordinary mortal reaction and whether you want to live in a god-emperor world or one where ordinary people get to muddle through as best they can, bickering collectively.

If your answer to every difficult question is “shut up and take my money Elon” (substitute member of your personal pantheon of Great Men and Women), well.. I guess we deserve the world we live in.

I’ve lived almost my whole 47-year-life in a world enthralled by Great Men/Women, starting with Reagan, Thatcher and Welch. In this entire period, believing ordinary people — only capable of and desiring ordinary lives — had a right to exist was the most unspeakable sin.

The idea that rule by/for/of the “people” in the sense of mediocre people of mediocre abilities and ambitions, had any value at all, came under relentless attack, to the point that we now seem to think we need Great Men to tell us how to put on socks in a Noble, Optimal Way.

A world that relies on Divine Intervention to function at every level is one where ordinary people increasingly degenerate to a guilty, apologetic, shame-ridden learned helplessness where their fundamental worthlessness becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Wasn’t going to go to this inside baseball level but why the hell not, since a lot of this just normification of NRx by people who may or may not know the term, as others have observed… 

So let’s go there. Thread after-party begins here 🤣 https://twitter.com/AlmostMedia/status/1514699225925259269

You see, the reason NRx and Woke hate each other is that they recognize they’re essentially the same thing: People with a deep-rooted Fear of Being Ordinary (FOBO) in denial of their own mediocrity BIRGing idealized greatness to recast themselves as At Least Chosen by Greatness

To be NRx is to believe Great Men like Musk can Save Us, and that you can transcend your own mediocrity by at least recognizing that fact, with some help from Straussian priesthoods interpreting the esoteric greatness in exoteric ways for your small mind.

To be Woke is to believe Great Principles like Social Justice can Save Us, and that you can transcend your own mediocrity by at least recognizing that fact, with some help from Straussian priesthoods interpreting the esoteric greatness in exoteric ways for your small mind.

In either case, what you get is a “get out of hard thinking jail free” via much simpler kind of gamified thinking within a Great Discourse whose point is to prove to yourself that you are Saved and Chosen via Proof of Recognition of Greatness.

Great Principle or Great Person is a distinction without a difference. In either case the Easy Thinking Games™ are administered by a priestly class gently educating you on right-thinking. What’s the proof? Doing it right gets you Proof of Chosenness via esteem of friends.

Each side can see through the self-congratulatory fictions and easy-thinking games of the other side, to the essential mediocrity being denied, but not their own. What neither will do is simply cheerfully accept mediocrity and ask how one can live well and build a world with it.

You know why? Because to actually think about hard problems is to constantly be reminded of your mediocrity. It constantly triggers your FOBO. Why not just trust distant Greatness and enjoy chosenness instead?

What makes supposedly Great Men great is that they are unreasonably effective and extraordinary in a narrow domain or two, but run into exactly the same FOBO problems outside, and flail and struggle and fail in thoroughly undignified and ungodlike ways that destroys the illusion

What makes supposedly Great Principles great is that they are unreasonably effective and extraordinary in a narrow domain or two, but fail spectacularly when naively overextended to Universal Truth status without lots of ifs and buts and compromises.

What kinda works is mediocre people who recognize they’re mediocre working with rules and laws they recognize as janky work-in-progress hacks that are at best imperfect heuristics for a time and place. Muddling through, committed to the infinite game of simply continuing to play.

This is why the Woke vs NRx battle, which has dominated my corner of social media for a decade now is so damn silly. Great People above Great Principles or Great Principles Above Everybody are both equally wishful fantasies born of FOBO… that there are easy answers.

Even the fact that NRxies (and their non-western equivalents like Hindutva types in India or Juche in North Korea) are usually ethnonationalists with genetic privileging of a Chosen People, while Wokies are in principle about everybody being Chosen makes no difference. Why?

In both cases the actual principle of Chosenness is the same: acceptance of Greatness, denial of the existence of mediocrity and ordinariness (let alone statistically tautological dominance of it), and violent repression of behaviors in themselves and others that trigger FOBO.

We have now wandered very far from should-Elon-buy-twitter, but we’re still circling the same broad question: should the ordinary be reduced to abject helplessness, in thrall to apparent greatness?

Or should the ordinary be let alone to simply do it’s best to continue existing?

I stan weaponized mediocrity wielded by the unchosen, who shrug off FOBO and simply half-ass life one day at a time, trying to live to half-ass another day, making do without religions of greatness, accepting that they’ll die some day, at which point it’s not their game anymore

I guess I’ve been on this rant all morning because Twitter has been one of the few places left where it’s still okay to be ordinary. It’s a haven for mediocrity that FOBOists used to hate and avoid. 🤔

In fact I invented the term FOBO in an old thread about people going off waldenponding to do Great Deeds. In that thread I recommended that people shouldn’t waldenpond.

I hereby reverse the recommendation. If you have FOBO get off twitter. Go be great, chosen ones🤣

This place is not a place of honor. No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here. Nothing valued is here. 

Mediocre people live ordinary lives here and you might catch it. Seek greatness elsewhere.

## 92. Against Chosen Ones

*April 27, 2022*

Recent events remind me of the plot of Terry Pratchett’s Sourcery

A Chosen One type child prodigy wizard, the 8th son of an 8th son, takes over Discworld because he believes wizards should rule the world. Vetinari is turned into a small lizard and caged.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourcery

Bit on the nose here

Twitter = Unseen University
Musk = Coin 

“Wizards should rule over muggles” = “Tech should rule over Wall Street and politicians”

Gonna be a rough ride

Coin’s father cheating death and inhabiting Coin’s staff is some sort of upload/longevity/board membership metaphor 🤔

This is the only Discworld novel where Vetinari is taken out of the picture. Normally he shapes events by ruling like a cautious democrat (though he’s got autocrat power) running interference on other people’s/groups ambitions and megalomania, maintaining a balance of power.

Sourcery is a tale of a balance of power being broken. Normally, Discworld has power balance among states, wizards, witches, gods, Death, nobility, dwarves, guilds, dungeon dimension creatures…

It’s a dynamic balance of power bending towards technological and social progress

Through the books, technologies get invented, there is progress, various disenfranchised groups gradually get enfranchised, etc. Very full allegory of neoliberal progress. Muddling forward, slouching towards utopia type milieu. Neither stagnation, nor sudden utopian lurches.

The unheros of Discworld tend to be open society balance curators and progress stewards like Vetinari, Vimes, Rincewind, Granny Weatherwax, Moist von Lipwig, and curiously Death. They often fight totalizing forces aiming to claim Discworld for the One True Way.

Rincewind fights mad wizards and dungeon demons. Vetinari fights off various imperial wannabes. Vimes resists ideological factions. Weatherwax fights dark elves and ambitious young witches. Death fights a totalizing bureaucracy (Auditors of Reality)…

Kinda interesting. Never noticed it before. Big Idea in Discworld is that infinite game needs constant protection by ordinary types against the designs of those who believe they are specially chosen in some way that calls for a Finite Endgame to establish them once and for all.

There are rarely any actual villains in Discworld. Just "main character" type chosen-one personalities who get a little too carried away by subplot dominance going to their heads and plot world dominance.

They often have defensible objectives in their own contexts, and even noble intentions towards those who don't share their Chosen One traits, based on idealized models of everyone else.

For eg: clueless-heroic "strong must protect the weak" type motives instead of outright-villain style "strong must enslave the weak"... but then as real events unfold, and the "weak" by whatever definition fail to be appropriately grateful for being "saved" judgment enters.

"The strong must protect the weak" turns into "the strong must protect the weak... if they are deserving."

"The right must protect the wrong... if they are willing to learn."

"The righteous must protect the sinful... if they are willing to repent"

Thing is, people rarely fit into the clean categories implied by the Chosen One ontology. They don't neatly line up and respond as expected of the roles in which you have cast them. So then you have to judge and act to "put them in their place"

It's an ideal orderly world where there is a place for everything and everything is in its place, and stays there. Within it, there is no difference between object relations (I-it) and people relations (I-you). Everything has a place and must behave predictably according to it.

The capital-T Theme of Discworld is that there are no main plots, only subplots. There are no main characters, only characters. I-you relations cannot be treated as I-it relations. The only way to play is to play to continue the game. "Yes, and..." type improv.

The only first principle in human relations is that every human is a set of first principles unique to themselves. To recognize another is to recognize that. You'll never fully understand the irreducible uniqueness of another person's existence through predictive models.

You can do better than predictive modeling -- you can do what I think of as "analogical resonance" -- Other Minds are not knowable, but you can notice resonances with your own. This is why the yes-and principle of mutualism is so powerful. It retains the humanity of the other.

It draws on the power of analogical resonance to relate another human's irreducible existence to your own, in a way that drives generative co-creation. You don't have to reduce them to a very small shell script or even a very good AI. There's lots of such improv in Discoworld.

If you're new to Discworld, this reading order guide is good. I've read almost everything. I started with Rincewind, moved on to City Watch, then Witches and Industrial Revolution.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld

## 93. The Fellowship Life

*May 3, 2022*

Now that I've experienced the fellowship life once, I can kinda see why so many free agents (pseudo free agents?) make a whole career out of it, jumping from think tank to think tank, fellowship to fellowship 🤔

I suspect my berggruen gig 2019-20 was a weird one-off and this pattern is not actually doable for me since I'm not an academic or other sort of "institutional production" guy... these things tend to have a seeing-like-a-state syndrome. Gotta be legible in their specific way.

From what I can tell, there's 4-5 distinct "fellowship" circuits -- public policy circles, "art" and literary residencies, journalistic sabbatical circuit (knight etc), and the youngest, the internet one (mozilla etc, now including Web3 treasury sources)

What's common to all of them is, unless you know someone at the top who is able to evaluate idiosyncratic apps personally, you *have* to be producing in a sort of captive market of cultural production, in a particular format (trad media publishing, books, policy papers, acad)

Lots of MFA-lit type fiction novelists seem to write books specifically for that very particular racket (sorry, but MFA lit *is* a racket) via a series of fellowships 🧐... museum-anchored art is similar, but imo less of a racket and with more actually interesting output

"Aging Creator Dreams of String of Fellowships to Ride to Retirement in Sinecureland" would be a very fun satire to write 🤣

Well, no rest for the illegible wicked. Must hustle our way to the grave.

Would be nice if more institutional money had the tolerance for illegibility that berggruen does... 

Most of these places, incidentally, are kinda 75-80% reserved for academics on sabbatical and/or revolving door influentials from adjacent institutions like fed govt btw.

So only about 20-25% at best is even available for genpop wildcard types... you're competing with tenured academics and fresh PhDs in a postdoc holding pattern for the most part

And the barrier to entry is actually higher. I'm not actually an exception. I didn't get the fellowship entirely on the strength of shitposts. It was a case of "we want you for your blogging etc, but it's your PhD that will actually allow us to get you past the gatekeepers"

It is almost depressing how much of a passport my PhD has been into all sorts of places where the substance of it was entirely irrelevant. It's the mere fact that I have one. Kinda like a security clearance. Feel bad for more talented/deserving people without this passport.

But the mechanism does work if you can access it. I made more progress on my book in the berggruen year than in the 5-6 years of nudging it along before in the interstices of consulting and blogging (been back in that mode since)

One reason I don't write proper "real books", besides having more of a taste for the essay length, is it's simply hard to work on longer projects in the middle of the boom/bust feast/starve indie hustle. Steady income is much more conducive to longer works.

My first book took ~3y while at a fairly comfy Xerox job... and working off material I'd developed during postdoc just before. This one's at 7 years and counting (I started research/developing it around 2013, soon after the first one)

... not counting the first couple of years where it was too ill-formed, but I think I made up the first outline for a potential book type thing in 2015

What's actually making slow progress possible now is that I'm serializing it on my substack, now at 5 chapters in. The steadiness of substack revenue creates something of the stability necessary to keep at it. I'm now guessing an ETA of 2025. https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-clockless-clock

None of these mechanisms is entirely ideal for me tbf. I'm probably too old and oddly enough "too useful" in some sense... my normal money-making methods are almost too pragmatic and effective for me to compete with more economically hapless subspecies of humanity.

If I were (say) a fine artist or avant-garde novelist trying to wrap those talents into a consulting package ("art for culture change!", "narrative leadership workshop!") it would be a different story. But my stock-in-trade is very pragmatic meat-and-potatoes consulting

I joke about mansions because that's actually the only logical endgame... 

2x2: useful to useless, impoverished to independently wealthy... I'm somewhere just north-west of the origin. Submansion class in both uselessness and wealth.

ie, I have to become somewhat more useless and somewhat more wealthy to hit the enmansioned leisure class

If some of my current bets work out, that's where I'll land. I'll turn 48 later this year, so goal is to be a privileged, entitled, useless burden on society by age 50, in time to ride out climate change securely in my mansion

One of things I am somewhat wary of is when much younger people claim to be "inspired" by my trajectory without quite realizing the extent to which I'm still coasting on the fumes of my earlier institutionalized PhDified life. It's like my personal store of fossil fuel.

I'm basically an industrial-age trustie who didn't actually start drawing on the trust fund till age 33. Just not the family-wealth type. To do something like I've done starting as an undergrad-only free agent at age 22, with no inherited wealth, would likely be 10x harder

## 94. Step by Step

*May 26, 2022*

Tagging an interesting microtrend that also looks important: a “step-by-step” ethos developing momentum. A general interest in break-king illegible learning processes into their component steps and refining them. A kind of process skill mindfulness. Like 6-sigma but for learning.

Exhibit A: The rise of prompt engineering https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1497652099701620738

Exhibit B: The unreasonable effectiveness of nudging prompt engineering down a “step by step” path https://twitter.com/IntuitMachine/status/1529476743114924034

Exhibit C: This remarkable viral video example of step-by-step prompt engineering for teaching a human. I had no idea doing backflips could be made this legible. This makes me think even I could learn to do them in middle age, though I’m not going to try https://twitter.com/Coach_365/status/1515227818942251012

Exhibit D: The accidental discovery at the @yak_collective that good prompts are all you really need to sustain a slow and steady learning track on any subject. We’re trying to develop that into a Thing ™ (details soon…I’ll link here when we go public with it)

Initially I thought “prompt engineering” should be called “magic spells” since you’re commanding illegible forces to do improbably miraculous seeming things with the right words, but this is exactly wrong. Prompt engineering illuminates and demystifies. It’s anti-magic spells!

I will add: the Wordle Revolution (no longer a “fad” since a dedicated minority among us have turned it into a healthy daily habit) belongs here. A nugget of accessible step-by-step thinking to warm up a mindfully step-by-step day. I wrote this about it https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/derangements?s=w

Step-by-step-ism (needs a better name) is exactly the antidote we need to a bunch of unhealthy things:

- vibing as a bad substitute for sense-making
- derangement syndromes as a chronic state of mental ill-health
- uncritical brute-force trial-and-error that learns nothing

I think we’re about to discover that there are “10x teachers” and that prompting skill is fat-tailed

Prompting and step-by-stepping is basically skilled teaching, whether it’s silicon or living neural nets. Except in the former you can also do some “brain surgery”

Thanks @kylemathews for reminding me of this piece. Yes, Blue Origin “gradatim ferociter” might have a moment again. I forgot I wrote this. Much as I admire SpaceX, long-term I think I trust this philosophy more, whatever the execution troubles.

https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/gradatim-ferociter?s=w

In general, I guess this is a swing away from both “one-shot” intuitionism where you get from A to B via a stroke of illegible genius AND away from the move-fast-break-things mode of inefficient learning where you get a high learning rate at the cost of high waste and risk

A more “slow is smooth, smooth is fast” approach to mindful learning.

There is also going to be a tendency to deny there us anything new here and an effort to identify this development with a favored old tradition. I’d suggest resisting that temptation. 

There’s more than “Socratic method, you invented the Socratic method!” here.

Oh, the big upside here is that only the *original* discovery of effective prompt patterns is a rare skill. Once discovered, others can easily copy. An ordinary gym teacher should be able to copy that clever backflip teaching method.

There’s a potential for a network effect here, and good prompt patterns driving out weak ones. 

And of course, a clever architecture may allow AIs to discover good prompt patterns to. PromptGAN?

“Cueing” is another good aspect with subtly different connotations from prompting https://twitter.com/sco/status/1529881116496130048

Also “scaffolding” https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1529880745598230528

I have a fair amount of college teaching experience. Enough to know I’m not naturally talented at this. Once I know something, I find it hard to put myself in the shoes (motherboards?) of someone who does not know. But when I’m in a patient mood I can sort of do it okay.

Some connections from an experienced educator https://twitter.com/aresnick/status/1529876945651085313

Stub to think about debugging and decompiling https://twitter.com/aresnick/status/1529878280903483398

I’m registering an Official Interest™ in this stebystepism trend so tag me if you spot anything interesting that’s related. 

It’s also the single most positive development I’ve seen in the zeitgeist in a couple of years. Step-by-step is how you work your way out of shit times.

Threshold concepts https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1529884287398559745

Another example. This helped me clearly understand something I never quite understood when learning it officially. Step-by-step from a counting problem to Riemann hypothesis https://twitter.com/3blue1brown/status/1528767362802929664

Oh shit, Asimov called this... this is robopsychology!

Also, this is the n-step version of google and twitter prompting

There is something here about growth rates. Stepbystepism is slower initially but accelerates to big momentum if it works. Uncritical trial and error is fast initially but either plateaus or crashes. And just vibing in one-shot ways just finds clever intutions without growing.

Zooming out to extreme macro, the growth vs. degrowth may be ill-posed. What if step-by-step is the DNA of tortoise like growth that doesn't backslide or crash as much? What if net, the tortoise IS faster than the hare?

Hmm... now that I think of it, my "sparring partner" approach is a step-by-step alternative to trying to "do" one-shot strategy. Instead of a fully-formed strategy being designed out of 2 days of leadership retreat BS, it emerges gradually, contour by contour

In any single sparring conversation, you might take 1-2 steps at most, but they add up over time. The strategy "takes shape" at the rate of actual alpha being uncovered in the situation, like a thing gradually revealing its full structure.

I'm unhappy with the term stepbystepism. I need to know the True Name of this thing. 

Possibly asynchronous sequentialism, as an antidote to the growing synchronous parallelism of the last few decades.

## 95. Construct Essentialism

*June 23, 2022*

From gender essentialism to construct essentialism https://twitter.com/VersoBooks/status/1539942040682758145

This language reminds me of how high-end fine-dining restaurants don’t name dishes but describe the recipe in brief, ie construct language

“Braised romanesco with fennel and bits of organic Soylent Green womb”

Except there novel dishes are actually constructed/deconstructed

The problem with construct essentialism is that we literally don’t have anywhere close to cooking levels of construction technology, at say genetic levels of control of hair color or something. “Social construct” really means “labeling a naturally occurring variety”

Since interventions to address gender dysphoria are at primitive levels (cooking equivalent would perhaps be skinning animals, and HRT is perhaps like the discovery of fire cooking), true “construction” accounts for a tiny fraction of variety. The rest is refined labeling.

And the battle over the high-value brand “woman” suggests something analogous to the lump of labor fallacy. Call it lump of humanism fallacy. 

‘There is a fixed amount of “recognition as human” available. To humanize one group we must dehumanize another’

The Verso tweet is a master class in negative-sum humanism games. It manages to dehumanize women *and* native Americans without achieving any meaningful gains for trans dignity. 

The only gainers are those seeking bureaucratic power in organizations through control of language

I won’t pretend I have easy answers. For eg, if a pattern of gender dysphoria only finds relief by presenting as, and being recognized as conventionally defined women in public, there is a hard zero-sum tradeoff between erasing one linguistic boundary and establishing another

Food offers examples too. For example, as a vegetarian leaning vegan, I kinda see the arguments on both sides of the fight over the word “milk” (appropriately enough, the “woman” of food)… and to a lesser extent eggs and meat. These are less fraught so easier to think about.

Like, we literally would not want differences between dairy, soy, oat, almond etc milks erased since people on all sides actually care what we put in our coffee or cereal. In some cases allergies etc are involved. Maybe not as much as about sexual preferences.

As expected original quoted tweet has been deleted, but this one deserves to live on in the twitter hall of screenshotted infamy, so here you go. You don’t get to delete tweets when you’re trying to erase identities.

In the bureaucratic language-power games, the linguistic “innovation” is consequential for forms and in databases. Which is actually kinda endgame-logical. In the distant future when men and robots can have wombs, “womb” should be a field rather than default entailment of “woman”

But in most contemporary social contexts, eg tweeting about history (as opposed to performing surgery for uterine cancer or deciphering what ‘would you like to come up for coffee’ means in undeclared-plumbing terms on a date), using dehumanizing construct language is idiotic

Assumed efficient defaults cannot automatically be treated as oppression by either majority or minority. Just because some burgers are veggie doesn’t mean using unqualified ‘burger’ to refer to a meat patties is oppression of vegetarians. I’m fine specifying.

The original pronoun wars are a good illustration. I’m happy to use non-assumed-default pronouns for you, or ask if in doubt. I’m not going to declare mine on my profile, but don’t have an opinion on if others should. If you make a mistake in addressing me, I won’t take offense.

Intent to treat others humanely is a matter of adult judgment not compliance with rules. We’re all minorities in some ways, and enjoy some majority/default privileges in other ways. Some enjoy more defaultness and some are perhaps burdened with more non-defaultness than most…

But defaults are neither good nor bad. They are inevitable emergent efficiencies of convention and behavior that leverage the statistical patterns around us.

And remember that plenty of non-defaultness (eg illness) is invisible. Whether visibility helps or hurts in a particular non-default lived experience is a case-by-case thing. I’m glad my appearance signals my ethnicity, but not my financial situation.

If you spend 10 minutes learning about these culture wars, you realize it’s almost entirely about grabbing institutional power while pretending to empower much larger groups the power-grabbers don’t actually have the consent to represent.

But you can’t run around withdrawing consent from every representation battle you’re represented in. Eg. most vegetarians/vegans don’t speak for me. Most Indians don’t speak for me. But I’m not going to go around playing misrepresentation-whack-a-mole. That’s intractable.

But I can reject attempts to police how I represent myself. And I can reject people who claim to speak for larger groups when I see no proof of broad consent. I can speak for myself, and directly to inferred groups I’m not in. In both cases there’s risk in rejecting power claims.

I’ve stayed out of posting a take on this particular battle within the culture war but have been tracking it for years. In a few DM convos, it is the main topic of conversation. I have a few trans friends and it’s clear to me that the language power-trip types don’t speak for all

It’s also clear that this is *the* strategic battle on which the culture war will turn. And the power-tripping construct essentialists trying to gain control over specific school boards and HR departments are either oblivious to the cost to the larger war, or indifferent to it.

The price of a few petty power-seekers doing this is externalities that just hand the initiative to the worst of illiberal reactionaries, and driving casual observers straight into their arms. Exhibit A is the weaponization of “CRT” by Rufo. A fine own-goal assist by the left https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1528072068629008384

## 96. Barbarous Ancestors

*July 2, 2022*

Increasingly thinking the founding fathers were exceptionally mediocre people who did some exceptionally mediocre thinking and even recognized it. Mixed in with some outright bad thinking,

Unfortunately generations of fragile nerds, who approach it the way comicbook fans approach the Batman canon, have elevated that mediocre work to a kind of divine status where it is subject to stresses of overextended use it can’t handle.

And between being very hard to amend, and the courts serving as a sort of retcon-cope nerd fandom, the fragility just builds and builds. It’s a very short constitution (among the better features) with astounding amounts of legal exegesis on top. Kinda like windows on dos.

I genuinely don’t get the religious fervor the cult of originalism brings to the party. It’s a hard practical problem of structural/procedural reform exacerbated by a group that sincerely treats a core document like it’s divine revelation with unquestionable authority.

I mean Jefferson basically copped to this view. He literally tagged his gang for future generations as “barbarous ancestors”

Saturday morning rant triggered by the speculation in the thread I’m quoting here. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1543268349630562309

No, 235 years of field use doesn’t make the case you might think it does. It’s a version of appeal to nature fallacy. Mere survival of a thing makes no case one way or the other about its moral value. Especially when propped up by violence. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1543275969250594817

Hmm. Arguably Hamilton did foresee and in fact seed the Industrial Revolution in his 1791 report on manufactures that set up the American System. It was just kinda against the spirit of the Jeffersonian constitutional grain. Michael Lind’s land of promise covers it decently https://twitter.com/David_o_Bedlam/status/1543286847203336193

My theory is that the American System, which arose despite the constitution rather than because of it (since it had a strong federal bias) paved the cowpaths of historic colonial luck with European technology imports and actually created American power https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_(economic_plan)

To the extent the job of politics and law is to articulate and codify a causal and moral rationale for good fortune (aka claim parentage of success), you could say the deadbeat parent got custody of the prodigal child and the nurturing parent got ignored and cut out of the story

Good question. I suspect perhaps the only morally defensible goal of a constitution is planned obsolescence. “This document will explode into flames in 42 years and you must hold a constitutional convention to reboot” https://twitter.com/Oneoneder/status/1543293814391148549

27 amendments in 235 years, the most recent proposed in 1791, in year 4, and only revived from the dead and acted on 202y later. “Submit a diff” = “fuck you” basically https://twitter.com/jeremiahrogers/status/1543298882439823360

Amendability is a tough design variable. The Indian constitution is 105 amendments in 75y but then the doc itself is way bigger and there are 3 types. Various US state constitutions are all over the place. Alabama is 977, California is 516. https://ballotpedia.org/Number_of_state_constitutional_amendments_in_each_state

Declaring the American experiment an unqualified success (ignoring negative externalities both domestically and globally) and attributing all that presumed success to the genius recipe of the constitution (ignoring historic luck and depredations) = bozo patriotism. Flip bozobit.

Bozo patriotism is eating the world

This problem is not unique to the US but is most pronounced here due to the odd combination of simultaneously being the oldest modern state and youngest nation

Vaguely related… I’ve been part of a weekly governance studies group at the @yak_collective for 2 years now. This stuff is hard in ways ordinary PoliSci people just don’t appreciate because they dismiss technological change as rounding errors (eg DAOs) to historical experience

We read and discuss a mix of recent history and tech stuff and old history/case studies. Approaching new technological potential in a historically informed way is just plain hard.

Eg yesterdays session discussed, among other themes, whether blockchains could do better with historical travesties like this ugly handling of a native rights case in SoCal. Our conclusion: we have no good ideas. https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=200320040AB2272

I suspect the right move when you can’t think of good answers to hard questions is to loosen your grip on the situation and merely hold the questions and let a bit of anarchy reign for a bit for new creative possibilities to emerge. Not rush to precipitate new commitments.

Unfortunately hard to do when the iron grip of history has rusted in place and there is no way to open things up and entertain hard questions. Creating and holding space itself seems to demand the violence of revolution. Which is often a cure worse than the disease.

Feels like America runs on a kind of fossilized serendipity that basically ran out around 1974. The tech boom (built on 60s/70s serendipity) masked it for 50y but is no longer strong enough to mask. Need new lightning bolts of luck.

## 97. Explainerism vs. Inventoryism

*August 7, 2022*

Just hit me that explainer journalism is the one genre of modern pre-Weirding media that survived the Great Weirding completely intact. Didn’t miss a beat. 

It got big explaining the subprime crisis and has taken everything since 2007 in its stride.

Vox-style in particular. Later Bloomberg and now half of substack’s top shelf stuff. It’s never surprised by anything and has 20-20 hindsight reassurance for everything.

The View from Knowhere 😂

I like the better stuff like Matt Levine but the median explainer newsletter or byline is kinda awful

The worst stuff is of course particularly bad faith and disingenuous but even the best stuff by the hardworking good faith types seems to have an epistemological weakness running through it I can’t quite put my finger on

Gonna sleep on this and dream mean critiques

Having slept on this, I think the problem is actually a statistics-based epistemology. Doesn’t matter if it’s Fisherian or Bayesian, Silverman or Talebian, rationalist or traderist. If your world view is rooted in statistics, it fails to comprehend phenomena past key boundaries

The boundaries are ontological.

1-0 boundary (existence to non-existence, ie death, ruin, non-survivorship) which they recognize but don’t grok

0-1 boundary: things coming into existence from outside modeled realities

Non-ergodicity boundary, which breaks 90% of their thinking

Explainerist thinking, done well, is strongest while *categories* are already established and robustly persistent and plurally instantiated in ergodic ensembles. It struggles where any of these weakens.

Silverman = Silverian as in Nate Silver

You can see explainerists struggle with ontological analysis. For eg, while studying statistics of inventions and discoveries is vaguely interesting, it’s sort of besides-the-point metadata. The core phenomenology is path-dependent ontic creative destruction.

Thiel tries to square this circle by posing a calculus vs statistics allegorical dichotomy. Where “calculus” is the determinate limit of degenerate statistical regimes (outliers, super early/late things, very low-noise regimes like orbital mechanics). This is doomed.

Doomed because you only grapple with the ontological unknown-unknown in terms of the inviolate known. Even the “black swan” metaphor fails, constructing the new category via combinations of old  categories.

“Flying car” (airplane + car) is an explainerist thing to dream of. A composition of existing categories with known values and a plausibly value-able composition. It is a pre-processed 0-1 that can be explainerized even before it appears (“here’s why flying cars have struggled”)

0-1 is a revealing frame. A 0 is a thing that does not exist in reality but is already modeled, valued, and accommodated in your reality. A very low (but NOT zero) likelihood future you can try to move from outlier to core through strategic action.

“Non-being to bring” != 0-1

“140 characters” is a raw phenomenological, ontologically uncomprehending way to react to the sudden appearance of twitter. That’s a non-being to being event that cannot be pre-explained or valued. It is not a “black+swan” or a “micro+blog”. It’s a new ontological primitive

Imagine a ship of Theseus but for ontological categories. The mast breaks and is replaced with twitter. The sails rip and is replaced with quadrotor drones. Your reality is going *categorical* creative destruction. The explanatory ground of your world is being undermined.

This is not primarily a “rare, outlier path dependent” thing though it might be that too. It’s a paradigm shift in the foundations of the explanatory impulse altogether. You can still do calculus and statistics. You just have to work with new categorical primitives.

I think this is why explainerist thinking feels so alien to me. I can sort of do it, but it feels painful and boring and missing the point of whatever I’m thinking about. Because usually my interest is in figuring out what new category is coming into being and how it behaves.

Edit: Having made my finer distinction, I’ll replace the 0-1/1-0 terms up thread with NB-B and B-NB (nonbeing-being, being-nonbeing). 0 is the wrong signifier for non-being. We didn’t have zero twitters in 2005. We had twitter not-being.

It’s not that explainerism doesn’t work at all on the new thing. It just has poor traction. You can still explainer (I’m verbing it to distinguish it from explain) it to the extent it impinges on existing categories but you’ll miss all the substance that inheres in the newness

For example, if zombies appear tomorrow, you can explain statistics of zombie attacks, what the most efficient beheading tool is, etc. But you won’t get at the intension-with-an-s of zombieness. And as the category comes to dominate more of reality, your explainering will weaken

Yes… the only question the old ontology can meaningfully pose about the new one is how to kill it, banish it back to non-being instead of either accommodating it or worse, being accommodated by it https://twitter.com/AndyCatsimanes/status/1556356217869565953

Explainer podcast: “There’s basically 3 ways the market can react to zombies: increased demand for machetes, inverted bond yields, and increased federal incentives for new machete-tech. Investment in DARPA X-tech fell from 0.1 to 0.01% 1960 to 2022, so it’s down to the first 2”

“Well last month, zombies actually appeared, growing at 100% week-over-week, and it looks like machete demand is up as predicted, but curiously, the demand for high-carbon steel was *down* during the same period. Turns out, there are weird incentives at Chicago Metal Exchange!”

“Bond yields however,… hold on a sec, someone at the door…”

“What noooo!!”

“Braaaaaaaiiiiiiins”

I hate to parody Matt Levine like this since he’s one of the Good Ones, but that’s the problem. Even the good ones are trapped by explainerist epistemology.

The Great Weirding has been about 1/3 ontological primitives being swapped out for new ones. So explainerism has come to seem like 33% more surreal to me. I’ll read a thing and want to yell “DO YOU NOT SEE THE ACTUAL ZOMBIES BEHIND THE MACHETE FUTURES??”

When ontologies shift, there’s a shift both in how you explain things and  *what is worth explaining*

In some ways explainerism is an economist’s disease wherein money is always the only thing worth explaining and the only means for constructing explanations. Market theology.

The opposite of explainerism is probably what could be termed inventoryism. Where all you do is characterize, categorize, memeify, and taxonomize the newly beinged. It gropes in the dark where explainerism is confidently looking where the ontological light shines.

Inventoryism chooses confusion in the face of the totality of being over comfort in the declining explainability of a shrinking part

## 98. Hypercomplexity

*August 15, 2022*

The LOTR movies are now 18-21y old. Entire generation born after them is headed for college 🤯

Watched the first part (Fellowship) and then read the Wikipedia on the production. This thing was the Apollo program of film. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)#Production

$281m in, 3B out
150 locations
7 units
438 days principal photography, 1000 total
2400 people involved at height of production

48,000 pieces of armour, 10,000 arrows, 500 bows, 10,000 Orc heads, 1,800 pairs of Hobbit feet-shoes, 19,000 costumes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_of_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_series#Filming

Rewatching last m=night I was struck by how huge this achievement was. Jurassic Park was the Mercury missions. This skipped Viking.

It was as big a leap over ILM tech of Jurassic Park era as ILM had been over trad 80s tech. They basically invented a new era of FX.

And the capital raise had to deal with Harvey Weinstein assholery along the way and it might have turned into a horrible 1 or 2 film treatment driven by scared bean counters if New Line hadn’t rescued the project from Miramax and let Jackson go all out.

Concurrently shooting 3 major movies at once and keeping the architecture coherent and startlingly true to the books (at least by my standards) across this country-scale project over 438 days, when Jackson was apparently sleeping just 4h/day…

This is systems engineering at its finest. The filming was radically out of order and fragmented due to logistics complexity apparently. Some scenes had shots filmed a year apart. Yet the in-story chronology flows beautifully. The temporal continuity must have been nightmarish.

To compare to another mixer complex systems engineering marvel, iirc it takes perhaps 30m and ~150-250 people involved to design and tape out a modern computer chip (not including the fab capital) (@magicsilicon might have a better rough number). So LOTR was about 10x complexity

Unlike the other path-breaking movie of the time, the Matrix, this was very well-known material with pre-existing strong visual anchors, so it’s amazing that what came out looked so vast and awe-inspiring while largely staying true to expectations of what it *should* look like

Anecdote that struck me: Ian McKellan didn’t bond much with the hobbit actors since he interacted more with the scale body doubles.

Another: some sets built at 2 scales, one for human and elf, another for hobbits and dwarves. They picked slightly taller dwarf actors to avoid 3.

They shot the road-to-Bree scene first where the hobbits hide from the Ringwraith, to give them a chance to bond

There’s a gazillion little details like this. I’d honestly watch 8h long making-of miniseries.

I can’t even imagine the top-level narrative architecture problem: unbundling the books into a storyboard, then screenplays (Fran Walsh described the screenwriting as laying track in front of a moving train), and then keeping the out-of-order production Gantt chart straight.

In many ways this was a bigger achievement than MCU. MCU is 10x bigger in scale (40 films?) but is relatively much looser material, more forgiving tonally (humor > drama) and done in a far better tech era 10-20y later, with far more mature CGI. It’s also more uneven.

Another detail: crew assembling the plastic chain mail wore out their thumbprints. The sheer grind of assembling thousands of bits of chain mail…

And finer touches too…like a jeweler designing Arwen’s pendant thing. Takes a Galaxy brain to keep priorities/proportions straight.

Was just getting to The Hobbit… of course a disaster. This time because the damn bean counters got too greedy and prevailed. Stretching 1 movie into 3 instead of compressing 3 into 1. Plus the tech was mature instead of pioneering, and I think Jackson might have lost idealism. https://twitter.com/0xfbifemboy/status/1558881310550200320

The contrast between LOTR and Hobbit trilogies underlines the importance of a) right-sizing the creative canvas for the material b) the difference missionary design idealism makes to architectural integrity. LOTR was Mac, Hobbit was Windows Vista era PC. Cathedral vs Junkspace.

Similar contrast between MCU affectionate narrative ramp with time gif each character and the disaster that was DC’s Justice League superhero role-call that even Zach Snyder cut could not redeem. You have to care more about the story than the money or you get narrative Junkspace.

I mean it’s literally 1 book of raw material vs 3. You can’t upsample with interpolation by 3x. It’s like “Computer: enhance!” bs. I don’t think the epic cinema moment has passed. You could still make good movie trilogies out of good, highly visual book trilogies https://twitter.com/medjedowo/status/1558883114767753216

One of the reasons LOTR is unique is it's a rare true trilogy, not spilling over into 4, 5, 7, 10 books. Beyond 3-4 volumes of a single core storyline, I think you are forced to go to prestige TV to get it right. Nobody has patience for 3+ movies in a straight-line story.

MCU works because it's a poset rather than a straight line story.

Foundation, Wheel of Time, etc. had to go to TV. LOTR prequel based on Silmarillon material too... more TV than movies.

Dune is the exception. A zillion books, but only like the first 2.5 are any good.

Reading Terra Ignota now. I think that would work as a trilogy (it's 4 books). Recently read Lillith's Brood. Also trilogy suitable. And Schismatrix Plus perhaps. In fantasy... any major material that stops at 3ish and hasn't been done? I think Gormenghast perhaps.

3 movies is really optimal for a single storyline. Another that nails the medium-story fit is the Nolan Batman trilogy. Original Raimi Spider-Man tried, but unravelled completely in the third part. By the time we got to Avengers, the extended universe context made it different.

I actually can't think of any single storyline movie series that worked to 4+ parts. Things like James Bond are more like sitcoms in that they are episodic stand-alone stories within an unchanging context (though latest Bond thing tried a bit of extended universe long-arc-ing)

I'll never cease to be impressed by a single human brain grappling with the limits of heterogenous complexity at vast scale, across dozens of modes.

The key  is heterogeneity. The complexity here is arguably of a higher order than of what say a mathematician like Grothendieck wrangled into submission, since that is a kind of cognitive monoculture inside a savant brain. Ditto people who architect say big pieces of software.

What kind of brain can keep a zillion moving parts of *different types* in its head with auteur rigor like this? Story, vast laboring crew, actors, top creative lieutenants, props, fx tech, capital raising politicking, schmoozing governments, field infrastructure...

I can keep fairly big piles of ideas and thoughts in my head, but it's... just thoughts, and even with that least forgiving of material, I can't reach these scales of mental heavy lifting. Even with the best project management discipline.

And note the sheer time pressure. Many CEOs run more complex empire, but they do so one quarter at a time at a steady tempo for years on end, with no definite expectations. This was an intense 438 day heavy lift where 90% of the complexity was being wrangled all at once.

I'd say during that one core production year, Peter Jackson was probably operating at like 3x Steve Jobs or Musk-level. A one-rep max, but still. I'm surprised he didn't break down into a screaming nutjob by the end of it.

It's easy to get into flow if you mainly do 1 kind of thing in 1 kind of workflow. And once you get into flow, output is a simple function of raw physical energy/stamina and your leverage scaffolding. But doing it with 10 kinds of thing in 10 kinds of workflows is 1000x harder

There should be a term for this. Something like breadth-first heavy-lift architectural intelligence. It's not IQ, it's a different trait. I've met people with genius levels of this, and they tend to be above average intelligence in trad terms, but not geniuses.

"Architecture" is not quite it though. There's a full-stack, end-to-end quality to the thinking that architects of any sort typically lack. Talented architects are good at laying out strategic contours and key tactical details. But not heavy lifts like this.

Like Tolkien himself would count as an excellent architect. But he worked primarily in a single strategic medium, the text. Closer to mathematics than epic cinema. On balance, I'd say making the films was a greater achievement than writing the books.

Speaking of Tolkien, I recall an interview where he said he was often asked why the eagles couldn't just drop the ringbearer into mordor, and he said his response was "oh... shut up!" (good humoredly). Elegant architecture can get away with logic fails in a way movies can't.

I wonder what the most full-spectrum complex thing humans do that is driven by a single individual. I think it's a three-way dead heat between bleeding edge space missions, complex movies, and computer hardware (bottom half of stack from silicon to low-level system software)

Top-half-stack software is more sprawling complexity of course, but it's not a singular vision and doesn't need to be. 

So the 3 wonders of the modern world are:

1. JWST or Perseverance
2. Recent chip like say Zen3 or Apple M2
3. LOTR

I might add a modern aircraft carrier to the mix. A floating nuclear-powered city that's the closest thing we have to a deathstar.

Hehe https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1335387266982707200

Something like LIGO I think belongs in a different event at the civilizational olympics. It's the 100m dash where the kind of complexity I'm talking about is probably the Decathalon... https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1558905195429384192

DOh! https://twitter.com/thezhanly/status/1558906204931473408

Okay I stand corrected re eagles plot hole. I not a true tolkien nerd, and like the movies way more than the books, which I've only read through twice and not in recent decades https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/lord-of-the-rings/22432394/eagles-lotr-plot-hole-mordor

Ah, didn't know this either. Still, I think even in the best case, no way the Hobbit can be stretched to 3 movies while staying true to the text. It would be 2/3 a different new story. Like say Cumberbatch version of Sherlock vs. Jeremy Brett https://twitter.com/atduskgreg/status/1558909944241393666?s=20&t=kKjS4lem8sJ9qtpUOze33g

I still think LIGO is fundamentally a different sort of civ boundary than the set I'm sorta constructing here, but no question it's an equally demanding one... perhaps distinction is "surface area" of outcome. https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1558907122766622720

With apologies to A. N. Whitehead, Civilization advances by pushing the limit of the number of important operations which we can perform while actively thinking about them.

Jackson etc represent a sort of hyper-Whitehead mode of advancement. The highest bandwidth (volume x velocity x variety) unautomated thinking you can do on top of the most mature automation available 

Raising the ceiling, as opposed to the floor or a single pointy spire

V-V-V was a phrase used to describe big data. Here I’m using it to characterize hypercomplexity

Classic complexity: simple rules lead to complex behavior 

Hypercomplexity: hold my beer

Complex rules (showrunner bible, carrier operations manuals) lead to hypercomplex behavior

Good point. I think they pulled it off because each book of HP except the last is 80% isolated side quest, 20% Voldemort battle. The school-year scaffolding helps that. https://twitter.com/djinnius/status/1558937162170744833

Definition: a system is hypercomplex if you can imagine a fat Robert Caro book existing about it

A system is merely complex if you can only imagine a James Gleick book about it

A system is pseudo-complex or not-even-a-system if you can only imagine a Malcom Gladwell book about it

## 99. Bureaucracy is Good, Actually

*September 20, 2022*

Bureaucracy at its best is the art of ensuring work never flows backwards  in a system where nobody can see very far, by overengineering the output at every stage. It’s the essence of good fat.

You bundle in everything the rest of the work chain could possibly want so it doesn’t come back to your desk. This is no mean achievement. Complex systems *want* to develop feedback loops and keeping them feedforward without knowing exactly what the forward path needs is hard

So you solve by over-communicating. Ask for everything pass on everything. There is a world of sophistication in the idea of a “supporting document.”

Dunno how I missed good bureaucracy as the epitome of fat thinking in my writing on the topic. Gonna finally read the Wilson bureaucracy book and become a Deep State stan. Windmills of the Gods.

People think all bureaucracy is bad because they fetishize the lean/private sector that solves for speed and growth over survivability. But solving for survivability is legit. You take 1 step instead of 10 but you survive 9/10 of futures instead of 1/10

It will be fun to troll my startup buddies who are all firmly in TINAT mode: There Is No Alternative to Thiel. Sad failure of imagination to not ask whether an institutional form 2000 years old might not actually know a thing or two.

Much as it sometimes annoys me like it does everyone, I can see the beauty of it. Covid theater, banking ooga booga, taxes… there’s a larger meaning to it all. Slow and steady forward motion (that lacks the hubris to call itself “progress”) regardless of imperfect information

The US has an outlier attitude towards bureaucracy: uncompromising hostility as a founding premise. Yet despite that, one of the greatest bureaucracies in history evolved here. By contrast private enterprise is a fragile flower. Collapses at first sign of environmental hostility

To free enterprisists and statists bureaucracy is categorically bad or good by vacuous moral presumption. To get to a substantive good bureaucracy/bad bureaucracy distinction you have to approach the thing itself with genuine curiosity.

“Bureaucracy Bad” comes across as a childish reaction to personal indignity at not being seen as the special snowflake human you are by a machine. On par with “Slugs Yuck.” Except kids don’t usually go on to “Kill All Slugs”

They get that the world needs slugs as much as puppies

“Bureaucracy Good” people are worse. People who love bureaucracies because they (sometimes) represent commons and protect+employ those who fail market-Darwinism tests generally understand the Tao of Bureaucracy even less than the haters. Social justice is values not explanation.

Have you tried *actually* seeing like a state? It only goes wrong when bureaucracies develop envy of private enterprise and try to *do* things. The raison d’etre of a bureaucracy is to prevent things from getting undone. Impose a cost on destruction not indulge in construction

The defining feature of bureaucracy is not that it moves forward very slowly but that it moves backwards not at all. For a bureaucracy retreat is death, not Schumpeterian resurrection Which means things where there is high value to not backsliding should be bureaucratic.

Ie believe it or not there are situations where this is a feature not a bug. It’s the institutional Terminator gene.

Yes, I often find myself landing on evil twin conclusions to taleb. To him all bureaucracy is fragilista intellectual-yet-idiot territory. Yet his own theories suggest otherwise. Bureaucracy is the most Lindy thing around. Hardly what you’d expect IYI fragilistas to run. https://twitter.com/steveglista/status/1572232250997248000

Tortoise vs hare fable is about bureaucracy vs private enterprise 

Also Blue Origin vs SpaceX. Notice how the former has had only one failure with New Shepherd, and that had successful high altitude capsule escape. They’re 10x slower but almost never go backwards.

“Agile bureaucracy” is the funniest contradiction in terms of you notice “forward only” means do-overs and iteration are BAD. 

Do or do not, there is no try. — Cabinet Secretary of the Force, Yoda.

Yep. The Jedi are a bureaucracy in case you were studiously ignoring that fact.

Blue Origin motto, Gradatim Ferociter, “step by step, ferociously” is a bureaucratic motto. And before you make with the jokes, remember for 60 years only bureaucracies got to space at all.

Not just Republicans though they are a uniquely virulent example. Around the world bureaucracies are coded the same way. The adversary that does it might vary but the result is the same. https://twitter.com/ilya_l/status/1572238461020606467

Anything you think is a bug that needs fixing is almost certainly a feature that helps the forward-only mission. Opacity, unresponsiveness, inability to ingest non-pro-forms information etc. All features. If you don’t get why you have unexamined speed > survival values

“Better that n murderers go unpunished than 1 innocent be hanged” principle is restatement of forward only principle. Stark. You’d rather have a bunch of psychos running rampant than punish the innocent. Vigilante states are failed states. https://twitter.com/ritwik_priya/status/1572241407410147332

Note that according to Scott himself the best modern form of seeimg like a state was an invention of private corporations (Taylorism) from where it spread to states, including both US and USSR. Waterfall planning came out of corporations too. 5y plans have corporate origins.

When I use the term “good bureaucracy” I mean it not in a moral sense but in the sense “true to its essential Taoist nature.” Good is merely all that has demonstrable persistence and can be perpetuated without undoing anything else.

Accretion displaces arbitrary definitions of “Progress” made up by morally self-important types that are always Regress to an opposed breed of moralist. Bureaucracy does an end run around that.

I thought of the perfect title for the essay I think I should write about this: Windmills of the Mods

The essay will also feature blockchains, and given recent experiences of Indian bureaucracy that inspired this thread, also what are known as babus (bureaucrats). We will discuss Blockchain Babus.

There is definitely some sort of natural Indian bureaucrat gene. At the risk of culturally essentializing My People, the "Indian CEO" stage of a tech company is also the "bureaucratization" stage. Consolidate and entrench.

Also ML. The inside of a bureaucracy is actually surprisingly squishy and wibbly-wobbly gooey procedural knowledge, not machine like. A bureaucracy is a large language model wrapped in a blockchain, all human powered.

I think I need to sub "true" for "good" in my model of the essential tao-of-the-bureau bureaucracy. In the sense that Hermes Conrad on Futurama aspires to be a true bureaucrat.

Good example. "First do no harm" is also a "don't backslide" isomorph of sorts https://twitter.com/MattAlhonte/status/1572273575301709825

## 100. Risk Larping

*October 4, 2022*

The fewer risks you take, the easier it is to be judgmental.

2 sub-cases:

Standard: Somebody takes a risk you won’t and fails

Special: You take what you think is a risk but isn’t really a risk for you, but others don’t because it’s actually a serious risk for them

Yes, if you take real risks. But if you take fake risks thinking they’re real, it makes you more judgmental not less, per special case above. Especially common with a certain kind of entrepreneur https://twitter.com/realizumikonata/status/1577350144000933888

There’s some sort of generalization of moral hazard here. Judgmental attitudes are appropriate when people try to socialize losses and privatize gains, reshaping their risk/return curved stealthily. But the core instinct to punish that kind of risk-cheating easily metastasizes.

Positive judgment seems to work better. When people take risks where upside is easily socialized (and hard to privatize) and losses are easily privatized, society seems to correctly esteem the results. It’s negative judgment that goes wrong.

Society seems to work on a portfolio effect where our collective risk-taking (per capita) is much higher than individual risk tolerances, with generally positive effects, but the dissonance distorts judgments.

“I’m nobly and selflessly advancing society with my martyr-level risks, you’re free-riding and socializing your costs, he’s a rent-seeking bond-villain.”

Everybody understates the risks they’re dumping on others, overstates the positive externalities and spillovers.

This is true whether you’re an entrepreneur, a soldier, or a social worker. Nobody can see the societal risk surface, everybody is doing the blind-men-and-elephant judgment thing.

At best you see the patch of the risk surface you’re disproportionately exposed to, and miss the patch of invisible socialized benefits you’re free-riding.

And you clearly see the villainy of your shadow/evil-twin’s choices. *You* would never make such morally corrupt choices.

This argument has merit but tends to be overstated. I know enough poorer/wrong-side-of-tracks entrepreneurs to be cautious about it. BUT, even the poorer ones often have strong advantages they understate. https://twitter.com/MattAlhonte/status/1577367893787951124

The most dangerous judgmental types are the ones for whom “do nothing off script” happens to be an exceptionally sweet bet. Ie the system’s defaults fit you well enough that you develop the illusion that all active risk-taking/script-breaking is irresponsible societal vandalism.

This is a wider net than you might think, since it includes all scripts, including scripts nominally devoted to change and progress rather than preservation. They may even work. It’s just that they work so slowly, and are so stable across generations, there are scripts for them.

A social justice mission that might slowly make the world fairer over decades (socialism) or centuries (Christianity, Islam) will induce scripts you can follow blindly.

Ditto economic development scripts that work for decades. “Silicon Valley” is 3 generations old already.

And scripts often position themselves as breaks from *other* scripts. But they’re scripts nevertheless. If it can be parodied, it’s a script. Even if it’s too young to have acquired multiple generations. And if it’s a script, it’s distorting your view of civilizational risks.

Being parodied and anomie are the 2 strong push-pull signals that can keep you ahead of maturing scripts. Though that’s no guarantee that your distortions will weaken. But being captured by scripts is a guarantee that your distortions *will* harden into judgmentalism.

It would be interesting to actually model the portfolio effect somehow. If you had 100 people with say n entrepreneurs, m social workers, p investigative journalists, q frontline first respondents, r soldiers, s homeless people etc, what does the net civ risk profile look like?

It’s hard to think of a societal role, however apparently lowly, that *doesn’t* contribute to the net risk reward function. There are no true NPCs.

Even people who seem obviously beyond the pale, like people building uninsurable homes in floodplains/hurricane zones/fire boundaries and expecting bailouts post-disaster, are helping learn the global risk function. Though it’s admittedly hard to be sympathetic.

Do you know in what ways *you* are building on a flood plain? Is for eg. all of academia a flood plain? Is making art and expecting Patreon/NFT income that different from building in a hurricane zone and expecting FEMA bailout? Super easy to rationalize your thing as prosocial.

I can’t actually think of a single unambiguous risk you can take that moves you from free-rider column over to net-societal-surplus column in an expected-value sense (ie regardless of outcome). Nobody deserves either zero benefit of doubt or uncritical admiration for their risks.

Fun thought. If we got rid of all government and did all redistribution through GoFundMe, perhaps our global risk-reward function would be a lot clearer. Impractical, like direct democracy, but revealing as a thought experiment. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1577390680397078528

A hypothesis I am comfortable venturing: human risk-tolerance range is far narrower than it looks, and to first order, is the same for all humans. All differences are a function of context, subjective factors, and path-dependent mitigating conditioning.

The main thing that changes risk tolerance is actually taking risks. Which progressively drives your perception of risks away from that of others. Divergence strikes again. Which might be why not taking risks makes you judgmental. You increasingly can’t fathom the divergence.

Test: if you take a real risk, your ideology will inevitably shift a little. If your ideology isn’t moving, you’re not actually taking risks. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1577347894494908416

I think I just figured out precisely why I really distrust strong-halo charismatic derp. People who preach an unchanging gospel for a long period are taking no real risks and never breaking from scripts. It’s a kind of degen ideological yield farming.

Converse not necessarily true. Ideological drift is necessary but not sufficient to conclude continuous risk-taking is going on. https://twitter.com/tapir_worf/status/1577413155348545536

## 101. On the Power of Weekly Time Commitments

*October 23, 2022*

Over the last 3 years with the @yak_collective I’ve really come to appreciate the power of committing a small amount of weekly time over a long period. If you have 10 hours to spare for me, I’ll pretty much always pick an hour a week for 10 weeks over 10 hours in 1 day .

Lifestyles tend to be stable for 3-5y at a time. If you commit 1 hour/wk indefinitely, that’s implicitly 150-250 hours if it sticks. Equal to 4-6 weeks of full-time, but that’s harder to use 🤔

An hour is optimal. Can’t do much with 15-30min, but >1h calls for too much org/prep.

It *sounds* powerful to get 4-6 weeks full-time commitment from a talented person (especially skilled ones who can code or design etc) but it’s actually useless because 4-6 weeks means you can create something complex enough to need maintenance/follow through.

I’d rather have you in back-burner “maintenance” mode where you do what you can an hour a week.

Older people have more stable lives and are more easily able to commit to such patterns which is why, interestingly enough, YC has skewed older than most things I’ve been involved in

Another interesting difference is that people who show up week after week with drip-irrigation levels of attention are able to do very different things (and *cannot* do other sorts of things calling for intense efforts). These things tend to feature infinite-game intentions.

This also favors older people. Younger people (understandably) have highly time-sensitive demands on attention, to “make it” in their careers/dating etc. Older people tend to have satisfied these demands somewhat and are more into “rest of my life” inexhaustible activities.

This pattern needs a name. Most social organizing is goal-oriented, aiming for ambitious things requiring intensive time/effort commitments. This is more systems > goals as Scott Adams put it. Build a “show up” habit first. Decide what to do based on who actually forms the habit.

An alt tagline for @yak_collective could be “building weird habits together”

Another nice thing about operating with an indeterminate horizon is that once a core basal metabolic rate has been established, it can absorb the vagaries of individual availability a lot better.

If you have someone full-time for 4-6w and they fall ill, your project is probably screwed. If you have someone for 1h/wk indefinitely, you can absorb illness, travel, spikes on other fronts, etc.

We’ve had people drop out/productively re-engage on YC stuff with gaps of *months*

It’s paradoxical, but even though young people have a lot more total time left in life they seem to have a far stronger sense of time-scarcity, like they must fulfill all ambitions by 30 because 30 is death or something.

If you have time-scarcity mindset, it’s far easier to commit 4-6w full-time than 1h/wk for an indefinite period.  Some weird discounting thing going on.

Also, fear of habit formation. 1h/wk forms new habits. 4-6w full-time harvests existing habits. Learning vs doing commitment.

This is kinda interesting. It’s easier to learn/form new habits when young, but your “habit bandwidth” is kinda limited by personality and it makes sense to be wary of how you allocate it. Because your habits define who you are by mid-30s or so.

35+ people seem mildly surprised by themselves if they learn anything new at all. They’ve been so conditioned to think they can’t learn past 35 or so, any learning/new good habits feels like an unexpected habit-bandwidth bonus.

A danger though is that a community built around “regulars” has less use for legible processes and explicit structure. People get to know each other and internalize norms and new people can’t easily read the group and learn how to participate. So you get bounce rates creeping up.

Like most discord-based communities we have a high pass-through rate. 90% of people come by, introduce themselves, and vanish. I’d guess 70% were just curious, 20% have misaligned “intense participation” expectations. The 10% who get it instinctively operate in “show up” mode

In rare cases, people show up again much later when they get it, and are in a place where a low-key “show up” pattern seems valuable to them.

Let’s call this pattern “show-up sticky systems” — complex systems whose  evolution is *entirely* a function of who shows up regularly. We’ve had strong and sincere participants show up and participate with intensity for a while, but sadly very little of what they do “sticks”

This means it’s not just hard to truly join, it’s hard to start anything new. Many people show up, are excited to find a decent level of existing participation, and imagine it’s available as a social “resource” to get interesting things done. Yes and no.

Yes, if you’re grok the “show up” frame. Say you show up for our Friday governance studies chat regularly for 3-4 weeks, and then propose a new track on say geology. You might get a nibble. Show up for 8 weeks and incept/notice geology conversations, much more likely to take root

In fact, so long as it’s not ultra-specialized, the topic doesn’t matter. People with a time-abundance habit-formation mentality tend to be rather indiscriminate in what they sign up for. The clincher is not the topic but a reliable driver and a (low) critical mass of 2-3 people.

Hmm. Just hit me that this is also how my consulting practice works for me at its best. If you want to hire me for 20h but use my time in a 1h/week or even 1h/month way, I can do vastly more for you than if you try to have me do 3 full-time “leadership retreat” days.

I suspect the common feature is compound interest on mutual learning. You get to know each other as well as the shared topic, in compounding ways. Not least because you shallow-sample an evolutionary trajectory rather than doing a deep snapshot.

For eg. We’ve been doing our rover project for ~2y now. It’s our most “intense” project since the weekly call is zoom rather than audio, and has presentations. Very slow. We’ve logged ~150-200 each I’d guess. 100h shared talk, 100h solo work…

…But I think we’ve all learned more and different things about rovers and robotics than we would have if had done an intense 200h “rover bootcamp” over 1 month. We’ve sort of built a sustainable rover-ing “habit” as a hobby.

Actually, an intense rover bootcamp *now* would be high value, though it would be hard or impossible to arrange (flip side of a lifestyle of many 1h/week commitments is it’s harder to just get away from your life to immerse yourself in 1 thing)

Yep, but it’s really easy to do that. Scraps of time here and there really add up around a core regular commitment. Time that would otherwise dissipate. Eg. a minute to notice and share a rover-related link. And it feels like harvesting bonus “free” time instead of zero-sum. https://twitter.com/Clearingfog_/status/1584271143493865472

Stuff we’ve done together:

2-3 reports
1 paid project
1 white paper nft
Half a dozen hobby rovers in various stages of maturity
Bunch of discord bots
Complex website
Roam db with a lot of content
3 study tracks with deep archives
1 coworking group
A “fermi gym”

Not counting a lot of individual collaborations and incubating things that haven’t quite stabilized

Show-up systems are the social equivalent of spaced-repetition learning I think. We evolve with bite-sized interactions. An hour a week is like reviewing a deck of anki cards regularly.

Another data point. MtG type products I guess are peculiarly well suited to this kind of development model. No intense launches or heavy lift finishes. Just steady progress. https://twitter.com/ReclusiveWizard/status/1584279847299211264

This is also the Shawshank model. Little hammer over 10 years does what a jackhammer for a day cannot.

It’s like how flowing water carves out grand canyons over millennia. Compare to say intense Hoover dam project.

## 102. Larger Concentrations of Money are Dumber

*November 9, 2022*

The larger the pile of money the dumber it is

If you have only $10 it is probably really smart money because you’re going to think hard and object level about spending it

If you have $10B, it’s being deployed mostly in > $250m chunks via org charts with 7 levels of bs theories

The largest object level thing you might ever buy even as a billionaire is probably like a car. Anything bigger, you’re actually buying a theory of ownership with multiple levels of abstraction each with assumptions.

For eg. buying a refurbished aircraft carrier — probably biggest “existing thing” that is ever bought — means buying training, maintenance, technology transfer, etc. Above that, retrofit/upgrade roadmaps, aircraft options, fuel futures… it looks like a “thing” but is not.

Huge state purchases like *new* aircraft carriers, bridges, space tech, etc. you’re buying a multi-level theory of development.

This is actually the problem with EA at scale. The philosophical principle is sound at $1000, sketchy at $1m, sketchy at $100m, and relish at $1b.

You cannot deploy >$250m on *anything* without a large bureaucratic org thinking through the details at multiple levels of abstraction, each vulnerable to capture by a bullshit theory.

Even if object level is uncontroversial like “feed children”

I know nothing about SBF personally… what mix of stupid/unlucky/unethical/moral-hazard etc was involved in the meltdown (Matt Levine explanation of using your own token as collateral seems to be all 4). But the EA thing is the novel element here.

Dunno if he was a sincere believer in the philosophy of it was some sort of influence theater larp for him, but trying to do good at the scale of billions within 1 lifetime has all the same dumb-big-money problems as deploying it for any other reason.

You need multiple models of reality as you scale. I’d say if N=$ amount you want to deploy, you should use log_10(N) theories to think about it. So $1m = 6 mental models. $1B = 9. Regardless of purpose.

EA is just *one* mental model of philanthropy. So good by itself up to $10.

Ugh major typos above

The philosophical principle is sound at $1000, sketchy at $1m, very sketchy at $100m, and religion at $1b.

I’ve supported people in making big money decisions but have not myself ever bought anything bigger than a car. That’s borderline between object level and theorized. We’ve been shopping for a house for the first time and it feels clearly like “buying a full-stack theory of life”

I’ve seen singularitarians express an astonishing sort of worry, that “obviously” the highest leverage kind of future-utility-maxxing EA-giving is to AI risk and that seems a little too easy (afaict this is why this crowd loves EA like PB&J)

Really? Ya think?

Fun math problem of the sort they’re actually geniuses at but never seem to do. If your theory of “Spend X$ on Y” rests on 7 layers of abstraction, and you’re 90% sure your thinking at each level is sound, what are the chances you’ll reach the right conclusion?

0.9^7 = 0.48.

This sort of thing has long been my main critique of wealth inequality. It’s not really a critique of EA in particular, but *any* single theory that an org proportionate in size to log(wealth) must embody to deploy wealth.

Large wealth concentrations produce stupidity at scale, *whatever* the theory and purpose of deployment. The most “effective” thing you can do is fragment it to the point it’s not quite as dumb. Unless the thing itself requires concentration, like a space program.

When people say they want “market-based” solutions to problems instead of “massive” state programs, the underlying intuition is not about markets so much as it’s about maximum scale of deployment an individual or closed org gets to do without orders from “above”

A “market-based” solution which leads to a huge corporation spending $1b government order via internal hierarchical decision-making is actually worse than a $1b government program that’s deployed as 40 $250k grants to smaller agencies. Latter is actually more market-like.

Of course this is not always possible. Not all problems can be partitioned this way. If you want to allocate $1b to a space program, giving 40 cities $250m to start 40 space programs is dumb. The problem requires concentration. But within physics constraints, unbundle the spend.

Heh sorry but ironically illustrates the point of errors creeping in with abstraction. 1b/250k is 4000 not 40. Plus I typoed it elsewhere as 250m (which would be 4) https://twitter.com/Cubecumbered/status/1590471695298875393?s=20&t=ciZdGQf3kPmwFNAxlCqJAA

people have made this sort of error while actually spending real money, not just shitposting…

I promise if someone gives me 1b to deploy, I’ll use an excel spreadsheet to do the arithmetic properly and hire an intern to crosscheck it it for decimal point and order of magnitude errors
