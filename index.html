  <p>Hi, my name is Venkatesh Rao (Venkat). I am a Seattle-based writer and independent management consultant. I mainly write at <a href="http://ribbonfarm.com">Ribbonfarm</a> and <a href="http://breakingsmart.com">Breaking Smart</a>. I am the author of a book on decision-making <a href="http://tempobook.com"><i>Tempo</i></a>. Before I struck out on my own in 2011, I worked in the Xerox Innovation Group (now part of Xerox PARC) between 2006-11. Before that, I was a researcher at Cornell University. I hold a PhD in systems and control (U. Michigan, 2004). </p>

  <a name="consulting"><h2>Consulting</h2>

<p>My consulting work primarily comprises 1:1 work with senior executives as a conversational sparring partner, to stress test and improve the rigor and quality of their ongoing thinking about their work. Karl Weick's short paper <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393789">What Theory is Not, Theorizing Is</a> is a good description of the natural process I try to build upon.</p>

<img src="weick.png" style="align: center; max-width: 600px">

<p>The working arrangement is usually just ongoing email/slack interactions, with 1:1 video-conference sparring sessions of 1-3 hours every 4-6 weeks (more or less often depending on the pace of developments). Occasionally a client will rope in a colleague or direct report to help drill down into a particular issue. There is usually no output product as such, beyond the summary email notes I send after every call.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I take on projects such as building system models, or preparing and delivering private workshops on specific topics at the request of clients.</p>

<p>My consulting models is best-suited for executives in medium-to-large organizations, and requires interactions over at least a year to yield results. Occasionally, I work with individuals, leaders at smaller companies and startups (typically past the product-market fit stage, with at least 25-30 employees and/or investment/revenue in the millions of dollars).</p>

<p>My current rate is $450/hour, and I typically only take on projects with at least 10-20 hours/year.</p>

<p> Clients usually find me directly through something I've written, rather than through a referral. Check out the <a href="#writing">writing section</a>. The links below are to some of my more business-themed blog posts, but it is often a non-businsess post that triggers a great sparring relationship.</p>

<a name="workshops"><h2>Workshops and Speaking</h2></a>


    <p>I develop and deliver customized talks and interactive workshops on specific topics at the request of clients, either as part of ongoing consulting engagements, or as one-off things. Topics I have covered in recent years include software eating the world (now available as <a href="https://ribbonfarm.teachable.com/p/breaking-smart-season-1/">a recorded workshop</a>), OODA-loop thinking, and energy transitions.</p>

<a name="writing"><h2>Writing</h2></a>

    <p>I mainly write on <a href="http://ribbonfarm.com">Ribbonfarm</a>, a blog I started in 2007, and which now hosts a large number of writers exploring diverse themes. I also write the seasonal essay collections on technology at <a href="http://breakingsmart.com">Breaking Smart</a> and the associated weekly <a href="http://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1-newsletter-archive/">newsletter</a>. You can find some of my older (pre-2012) writing in two ebooks, <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/">The Gervais Principle</a> and <a href="http://beslightlyevil.com">Be Slightly Evil</a>.</p>

    <p>I have written one book, <a href="http://tempobook.com">Tempo</a> (2011), on decision-making. It is something like a pop-science version of my postdoctoral research at Cornell on command and control systems.</p>

    <p>I've written a couple of pieces <a href="https://aeon.co/users/venkatesh-rao">for Aeon Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/author/venkatesh-rao/">The Atlantic</a>, among other outlets, and my writing has occasionally been mentioned in places like The Economist, BoingBoing, and The New York Times. Here is an interview with me on the <a href="https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-174-venkatesh-rao">Longform podcast</a>, and one on <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/02/venkatesh-rao-decision-making/">Farnam Street Knowledge Project</a></p>

    <p>I occasionally take on commissioned writing projects if there is a strong fit with things I want to write anyway.</p>
