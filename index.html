  <p>Hi, my name is Venkatesh Rao (Venkat). I am a Seattle-based independent management consultant and writer. I spent a decade in academic and corporate R&D, until I struck out on my own in 2011. You may have heard of me as the author of <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/">The Gervais Principle</a> and <a href="http://breakingsmart.com">Breaking Smart</a>.</p>

  <a name="sparring"><h2>Sparring</h2>

<p>While I occasionally taken on other kinds of projects, I mainly work 1:1 with senior executives as a conversational sparring partner, to stress test and improve the rigor and quality of their ongoing thinking about their work. Karl Weick's short paper <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393789">What Theory is Not, Theorizing Is</a> is a good description of the natural process I try to build upon.</p>

<img src="weick.png" style="align: center; max-width: 600px">

<p>The working arrangement is usually just ongoing email/slack interactions, with 1:1 video-conference sparring sessions of 1-3 hours every 4-6 weeks (more or less often depending on the pace of developments). Occasionally a client will rope in a colleague or direct report to help drill down into a particular issue. There is usually no output product as such, beyond the summary email notes I send after every call. Occasionally I might suggest a slide or diagram or suggest some language surgery for developing communication/persuasion needs.</p>

<p> Clients usually find me directly through something I've written, rather than through a referral. Check out the <a href="#writing">writing section</a>. The links below are to some of my more business-themed blog posts, but it is often a non-businsess post that triggers a great sparring relationship.</p>

<h3>Beyond Sparring</h3>

<p>Occasionally, I work more broadly with an executive's team or peers on broader organization-level challenges, or take on specific research tasks that don't fit into existing boxes. This usually means a site visit once or twice a year, socializing me with the appropriate team members via 1:1s, having me sit in on a few meetings, etc. In such cases it helps to explain why I'm there to your team. It is not a great idea to have me mysteriously skulking about your organization for no apparent reason. If the scope becomes broad enough, it sometimes helps to have me do a short talk on some relevant topic. Check out the <a href="#workshops">speaking/workshops</a> section for ideas on that.</p>

<p> A word or two about what I <i>don't</i> do (mainly because there are others who do it much better). If you are looking for structured processes, assessments, and operational audits of your organization, a functional process expert is probably a better choice. If you are looking for someone to define "leadership homework", or help with personal workflows and productivity, an executive coach, life coach, or productivity consultant is likely a better option. Though I have managed teams in a past life, my background and experience is in engineering R&D, not line management, so I do not offer, and clients do not expect, the kinds of support that traditional consultants with MBA backgrounds offer. In general, I am there to help with ambiguous things for which there are no playbooks and no obvious experts, and which require drawing from both business and non-business sources for creative breakthroughs.</p>

<a name="workshops"><h2>Workshops and Speaking</h2></a>

    <p>Currently I offer the <a href="http://breakingsmart.com/en/the-workshop/">Breaking Smart workshop</a>, an 8-hour deep-dive into how software is eating the world, conducted over 1-2 days. I am developing a second workshop in the series, on the future of organizations, which will be available starting April 2017.</p>

    <p>I also develop and deliver customized talks on specific topics at the request of clients, either as part of ongoing consulting engagements, or as one-off things. Here are the slides (lightly edited) from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/vgururao/riot-talkpublic">a talk I did on DevOps</a> for Riot Games.</p>

    <p>These days I don't do travel-expenses-only public talks/panels except as a favor to personal friends, or if the event is at an unusual travel destination I'm interested in visiting. Since I'm usually thinking about messy, discursive themes, I vastly prefer doing longer seminar-length (45-90 minute) talks to short blitz-style talks. Here are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guaANxY61us">a</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/vgururao/usc-annenberg">few</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwzEa-_9Nuc">of</a> my favorite public talks. </p>

<a name="writing"><h2>Writing</h2></a>

    <p>I mainly write on <a href="http://ribbonfarm.com">Ribbonfarm</a>, a blog I started in 2007, and which now hosts a large number of writers exploring diverse themes. I also write the seasonal essay collections on technology at <a href="http://breakingsmart.com">Breaking Smart</a> and the associated weekly <a href="http://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1-newsletter-archive/">newsletter</a>. You can find some of my older (pre-2012) writing in two ebooks, <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/">The Gervais Principle</a> and <a href="http://beslightlyevil.com">Be Slightly Evil</a>.</p>

    <p>I have written one book, <a href="http://tempobook.com">Tempo</a> (2011), on decision-making. It is something like a pop-science version of my postdoctoral research at Cornell on command and control systems.</p>

    <p>I've written a couple of pieces <a href="https://aeon.co/users/venkatesh-rao">for Aeon Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/author/venkatesh-rao/">The Atlantic</a>, among other outlets, and my writing has occasionally been mentioned in places like The Economist, BoingBoing, and The New York Times. Here is an interview with me on the <a href="https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-174-venkatesh-rao">Longform podcast</a>, and one on <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/02/venkatesh-rao-decision-making/">Farnam Street Knowledge Project</a></p>

    <p>I occasionally take on commissioned writing projects if there is a strong fit with things I want to write anyway.</p>
